    <description><![CDATA[<p>4 November 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is currently in the Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) phase of a £70million project to strengthen and refurbish the Hammersmith Flyover in West London on behalf of Transport for London (Tfl).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is one of the first tranches of work to be awarded by Tfl as part of the Structures and Tunnels Investment Portfolio (STIP), through a four-year Highways and Tunnels Framework awarded in April 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are delighted to have the opportunity to work in close collaboration with Transport for London on this strategically important project, which is a first for Costain’s Highways sector,” said Barry Woodman, Programme Director for Costain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The flyover was closed in 2011 when it was found that water and salt from winter gritting had leaked into the structure corroding the structural post tensioning cables. Five spans were repaired prior to the London 2012 Games.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is now tasked with strengthening the remaining structure, and replacing the existing post tensioning strands with a new system. The bridge deck is supported on a single central row of piers comprising 16 spans — eleven at 42.7m long, two at 30.5m, two of 36.6m and one at 22.6m — giving a  total length of 626m. The approach ramps at either end increase the total length to 863m.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The works also include replacing the roller bearings on the 16 piers and replacing the abutment bearings, renewing the bridge deck waterproofing, bridge deck drainage and outfalls, replacing expansion joints, renewing the carriageway surfacing and replacing the existing central reservation safety barrier along the length of the structure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is complicated by the age and size of the flyover, as well as its strategic importance to London’s transport infrastructure. The existing precast concrete segmental post tensioned flyover was originally opened in 1961 and today more than 90,000 vehicles a day use the busy A4 arterial route over the central Hammersmith gyratory system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“At Hammersmith, our aim is to work closely with Transport for London and our designers to minimise traffic disruption on this technically challenging project,” said Barry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project team has been co-located with TfL and designer RPB (Ramboll and Parson Brinkerhoff) in London since April to collaboratively develop the detailed design and construction methodology prior to commencing on site in late October 2013. The works are expected to be completed by summer 2015, extending the life of this structure for many years to come.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>31 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has joined the Climate Performance Leadership Index (CPLI) as one of the best performing companies in the Carbon Disclosure Project’s annual FTSE 350 climate change report.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain achieved an impressive score of 84 A, highlighting the positive impact the company has made in measuring and driving down its greenhouse gas emissions. It is also the only FTSE Small-Cap Company to achieve band ‘A’ status this year and only the second small-cap company to achieve an ‘A’ band rating since the ratings were introduced in 2009.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Carbon Disclosure Project is an international, not-for-profit organization which provides the only global system for companies and cities to measure, disclose, manage and share vital environmental information. Companies with a top score qualify to be listed in the Climate Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI) based on their sample group, which is determined by market capitalization.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gaining entry into the CPLI with a band ‘A’ rating indicates that Costain has excelled in its overall performance and represents a significant step up from the band ‘C’ rating it achieved in 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The disclosure score, which is normalised to a 100-point scale, reflects how comprehensive a company’s responses are within its CDP submission. A score of 70+ indicates the company has a strong understanding of its exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as an ability to measure and manage the company’s carbon footprint.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Claire Baker, Costain’s Sustainability Solutions Manager and one of the people responsible for driving a reduction in Costain’s carbon footprint, attributed the positive result to a number of actions the Company has implemented in recent years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The initiatives include the launch of the inaugural Energy Awareness Week and efficient management of Costain’s fleet. The Company also gained certification from the Certified Emissions Measurement and Reduction Scheme (CEMARS), which demonstrated that Costain accurately measures its greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with ISO 14064-1:2006.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has also established the Climate Change Group to coordinate the Company’s approach to climate change. The Group, which is made up of advocates from across the business, aims to demonstrate clear, visible leadership and ensure that the Company is managing its impact and maximising potential opportunities by providing low carbon solutions to its customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peter Fisher, Costain’s Safety, Health and Environment Director, said: “This is a fantastic achievement by everyone concerned. To gain entry into the CPLI and to achieve such a large increase on our previous years’ score serves to underline the commitment and hard work of our dedicated team to raise awareness of climate change issues within the organisation and to implement schemes which aid in the reduction of our carbon footprint.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>30 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has launched a campaign for people on the Severn Trent Water Framework to raise awareness about the risk of not wearing appropriate eye protection on site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Organised in conjunction with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB), the Building Sight Campaign was spearheaded by SHE Advisor, Laura Colleran, and is the latest high-impact employee well-being programme to be organised by Costain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“There are around two million people in the UK living with varying levels of sight loss and we wanted to ensure that staff and operatives fully appreciated the potential risks of not protecting their eyes while working on site,” said Laura.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Campaign trail spanned five sites across the Severn Trent Water Framework. Hour-long sessions explored the impacts of eye injuries, eye diseases and construction case studies. Participants also had the opportunity to try out eyewear adapted to replicate living with eye impairment, allowing them to experience for a short period what daily life would be like with impaired or full loss of sight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In line with Costain’s Behavioural Safety techniques, Laura also developed posters which replicate the four types of vision loss discussed in the Building Sight sessions. These posters represented just one element of the behavioural techniques necessary to keep the right behaviours going.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the high-impact campaign, participating sites were asked to monitor and gather data to measure levels of compliance and provide essential feedback to teams in order to promote appropriate behaviour.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Behavioural Safety Manager, Paul Thistle, said: “I’m looking forward to seeing the results from the sites that have been monitoring, measuring and providing feedback to their teams so we can identify initiatives that have worked well and share that good practice across all of our sites.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chris Fielding, RNIB’s Access Consultant, added: “It was a great opportunity to raise awareness of the importance of wearing eye protection, the injuries that can occur and the lasting impact on people's lives. The working environment contains many potential hazards but wearing good quality, undamaged eye protection that is suitable for the particular task will greatly reduce the risk of eye injury, and possible sight loss, with all the practical and psychological effects.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>29 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain recently attended the Institution of Civil Engineers’ (ICE) Transport Infrastructure conference where it advised client organisations about how technology can be used to improve the way they manage and invest in their assets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event, called the UK Transport: The Engine for Growth, was held at ICE’s head office in Westminster, London, and focussed on the importance of transport network integration and the need for long-term strategy development in the sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Guests included members of the British Government and the UK transport industry, including the Rt Hon Danny Alexander MP, Chief Secretary to the Treasury; Alison Munro, the Chief Executive of HS2; Terry Morgan CBE, Chairman of Crossrail; Sir Peter Hendy CBE, Commissioner, Transport for London; and Richard Schofield, Route Managing Director at Network Rail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ICE conference follows the release in June of the organisation’s ‘State of The Nation’ report into transport, which outlined a number of key recommendations for improving road conditions, planning and funding, as well as the need for a clear transport strategy for all parts of the UK.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ross Agnew, Costain’s Director for Airports and Technology, gave a presentation about future transport needs and how industry can connect people to infrastructure. The presentation was then followed by a Q&amp;A session and the opportunity to ask Ross about his vision for the interaction between people and the transport environment, and how data can play a part in bringing the two together.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Representatives from Costain then had a chance to tell some of Costain’s key clients about some of the technological innovations the Company is implementing on current infrastructure projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The event was a great opportunity to inform some of our key customers and stakeholders that Costain Technology Solutions is a core element of our service offering and instrumental in driving efficiencies and prompting a shift in the way customers analyse, improve, and optimise their assets,” said Ross.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>28 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain Laing O’Rourke JV team expanding London Underground’s Bond Street station is working “24/7” as it presses on with the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The site is as busy at night as it is during the day, as the team works to increase the capacity of the station which houses Central Line and Jubilee Line platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The expanded Tube station will join with the adjacent new Crossrail station to form one overall facility that will allow rapid transfers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More than 155,000 passengers currently use Bond Street daily, a figure expected to rise past 225,000 with the arrival of Crossrail in 2018.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work is focusing on the north side of London's Oxford Street retail hub to boost capacity and create step-free access to the station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In recent months this has included the demolition of an adjacent building – including the removal of a 1.5-metre thick concrete slab that formed the vault of a bank that formerly occupied the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At one point it was thought that small explosive charges would be required to remove the slab, but in the event, mechanical breaking-out caused less noise nuisance than anticipated and the latter method was used to complete the slab’s removal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since then, work on the basement and sub-basement of a new building has got underway. This will eventually be completed as apartments but is being used temporarily as a crane hall. Two shafts will be sunk inside it, from which tunnelling can be undertaken early in 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This building will be given temporary cladding that will help reduce noise, so that work within it can continue round the clock.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other challenges for the site team include “incredible logistic constraints” of the site, whose footprint means space is at an absolute premium.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work on the first shaft, with a sprayed concrete lining, is underway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The other current major activity is pumping grout in to the ground to harden it before tunnelling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are relatively few residential premises around the site, but the presence of a Radisson hotel next door means noise has to be kept at a minimum at night.  “We’ve had a lot of contact with the hotel, keeping people informed about what’s going on and we’ve kept very good relations with the local stakeholders. It's been one of the successes of the project," said David Whiteford, Deputy Project Director.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>28 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain recently showcased a number of innovative solutions for use in the rail industry at a forum organised for the Network Rail Asset Information team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event, which took place recently at Costain’s head office in Maidenhead, was organised to coincide with one of Network Rail’s regular team meetings. In addition to discussing Network Rail’s projects, the forum gave members of the Costain Technology Solutions team an opportunity to present some of their ideas to the 24-strong Network Rail team and discuss how the ideas could be harnessed for the benefit of Network Rail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Andrew Wyllie, Costain’s Chief Executive, also met the Network Rail team and discussed how some of Costain’s innovative solutions could potentially assist the Network Rail Asset Information team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the technological innovation included a collaboration between Costain and Perpetuum, a world leader in vibration harvester powered wireless sensing systems, to see how data can be used to better understand how track assets are used and where costs can be reduced in the ownership of rolling stock.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team also presented COpath, a partnership between Costain and Path Intelligence which specialises in providing insights into pedestrian movements. COpath utilises a brand new technology that allows users to anonymously monitor pedestrian movements through a physical space and then interpret that data as passenger behaviour. COpath gives asset owners a better understanding about how passengers use and interact with a physical space, and then allows them to analyse the data to make better decisions about managing their assets more efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It was a great platform as we were able to engage with individuals from one of our largest clients about some of the challenges they face in realising their asset management objectives and how we can assist them with our leading edge technology solutions,” said Ross Agnew, Costain’s Director for Airports and Technology, who hosted the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The forum is in line with Costain’s Engineering Tomorrow strategy which is focused on harnessing new and innovative technological solutions, but with the potential to help customers make a step change in their business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Effective asset management is essential in the successful delivery of all goods and services, not least in the planning and delivery of key infrastructure. Engineering Tomorrow recognises that to satisfy customers’ requirement and to meet national infrastructure needs, the Company needs to invest in technology, formulate innovative solutions, devise new ways of doing things and pass on crucial knowledge, both internally and to its partners and customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This type of direct engagement with our client is imperative for Costain to pinpoint our customers’ specific challenges and provide a solution that is not only more cost effective for operations, but also utilises leading-edge technology and allows them to remain responsive to their customers and end-users,” said Ross.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>24 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Coventry City Council has announced the appointment of the Costain Group as the contractors for the new bridge deck construction at Junction 6 of Coventry Ring Road, along with Atkins who have been appointed to design the scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bridge deck is a key part of the Friargate development at the railway station and the council's own move to a new office building on the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bridge deck will better connect the Friargate development to the city centre by removing the raised roundabout at Junction 6 and building a 100 metre wide connection across the ring road, creating a public boulevard linking the railway station through Greyfriars Green and connecting directly to Bull Yard in the city centre.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Council will be working closely with Costain and Atkins over the next few months as the detailed designs are put in place.  Work is expected to start early next year – with completion set for June 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cllr Rachel Lancaster, Cabinet Member for Public Services, said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are delighted to be working with the Costain Group and Atkins on this exciting project.  The construction of the bridge deck and the Friargate development that follows will kickstart the regeneration of our city and will show that Coventry is open for business.  The improved link to the city centre from the station will also support our aspirations for the city centre south redevelopment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The bridge work is being fully funded from a Regional Growth Fund grant and I’m pleased that there was so much interest in undertaking both the design and build work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is the perfect opportunity to break through the ring road ensuring greater pedestrian access from the city centre to the railway station, without disrupting the flow of traffic on the ring road which at junction 6 runs underneath the junction.  Once completed, the bridge deck and new boulevard will make up one of the most attractive and impressive walking routes into a city centre from a railway station of any city in the UK.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Phil Davies, Asset Support Framework manager for Costain, said: “We are absolutely delighted to have won this prestigious project and look forward to working with Coventry City Council and all the key stakeholders to manage and deliver the project sensitively, safely, on time and to budget.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Funding for the £12.7m bridge deck project has been secured from the Government’s Regional Growth Fund and Coventry City Council will be the anchor tenants once the Friargate development is completed.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>23 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has joined forces with innovative careers website ‘plotr’ to encourage more young people to consider a career at Costain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Announced at Costain’s ‘Big Infrastructure Conversation’ event at City Hall in London on September 30, plotr is an on-line careers service for 11-to 24-year-olds that is free for young people, parents and teachers to use. Founded in 2011, plotr is a not-for-profit Community Interest Company that combines input from careers advisers, youth organisations, teachers, leading technology and social media companies and hundreds of young people to create an innovative and informative careers advice platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the largest and most influential employers are already involved with plotr, including Barclays, Serco, Deloitte, Centrica, National Grid and Williams F1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s collaboration with plotr is in line with Costain Cares which aims to invest in young people, provide career opportunities and help the industry address a long-term skills shortage. It is also in line with the Engineering Tomorrow strategy, Costain’s commitment to identifying, developing and implementing innovative solutions to meet the UK’s major national infrastructure needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“A big part of Costain Cares is how we support young people into employment and trying to open up different career routes into Costain through traineeships and apprenticeships,” said Catherine Warbrick, Costain’s Corporate Responsibility Director.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Plotr will help us to raise awareness about what we do and hopefully inspire young people to gain the skills to want to come and work in our industry. The industry requires a diverse range of skills and plotr will help us to attract young people who may not have considered a career in construction engineering or a career with an engineering company,” Catherine said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of plotr, Costain has created the ‘Costain Career World’ to represent the sectors the Company operates in and included 11 job roles to demonstrate the various careers available within the Group. The jobs are a mix of entry level and aspirational roles and the site offers advice about how you get started, what skills are needed, what qualifications are required and what salary might be expected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is also a short video clip of a Costain employee talking about their role, how they got started, what their key skills are, what they love about their job and, as with all jobs, what the biggest challenges are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The site will be regularly updated with vacancies for work experience, apprenticeships and graduate training positions, as well as forthcoming employment events and seminars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are committed to opening up access and creating more opportunities for young people. The information on the plotr site builds up a realistic picture of what work life is like, what we are looking for as an employer and about how young people can take the first steps towards employments,” said Catherine.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>23 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is celebrating two wins at this year’s Highways Magazine Excellence Awards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The £32 million Walton Bridge for client Surrey County Council won the Major Project Award, beating off stiff competition from the M25 DBFO contract and the Boston Manor Viaduct.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A-one+ - the Halcrow/Colas/Costain highways service provider - won the Site Safety Initiative Award for its No Strikes IPV (impact protection vehicles) awareness training. It beat a lone worker monitoring initiative and a scheme to reduce carriageway crossings to the top prize.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both Costain staff and clients attended the awards ceremony and gala dinner at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London on 10 October, joining hundreds of others at what is one of the most popular and prestigious nights in the highways industry calendar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Major Project Award for the A244 Walton Bridge Project was “deserved recognition for an excellent project that included constructing a striking steel arch bridge and overcoming numerous engineering challenges,” said Andy Bannister, Project Manager.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The work involved demolishing two existing bridges over the River Thames and replacing them with a landmark steel thrust arch structure. The first new road bridge over the Thames in 20 years, it opened on programme in July this year. Commented the judges: “This was a vast project incorporating the best principles of planning and construction.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The A-one+ award winner takes a new approach to a long-standing problem: haulage drivers colliding with IPVs at night during traffic management schemes. A-one+ has devised the No Strikes IPV awareness training programme that it is currently taking to the haulage companies. So far around 150 drivers have received the training and feedback has been very good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We realised we had to look at this problem in a new way that involved the drivers,” said Clive Leadbetter, General Manager, MAC 14. “The aim is give them an insight into how we work and what the IPV does and means to them as road users and, importantly, to hear from them why they think collisions occur. This will help us develop the IPVs further to ensure that the warning displays have maximum impact.<br /> <br />“Winning this award will raise the profile of what we’re doing, which will hopefully help spread the idea and ultimately save lives.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A-one+ just missed out on two other awards. The Woodhead Pass marking and studding maintenance scheme was shortlisted for the Road Marking Project of the Year, and its A64 Bishopthorpe south bridge joint replacement made the shortlist for the Most Innovative Highways Agency Project of the Year.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">18 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Southern Water’s £300 million Cleaner Seas for Sussex environmental scheme, of which Costain and its 4Delivery partners MWH and Veolia Water were principal contractors, officially opened this week. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The scheme is Southern Water’s largest ever project and includes 11km of new sewer tunnel, two pumping stations, a wastewater treatment works and a 2.5km long sea outfall. The scheme ensures that the 95 million litres of wastewater produced each day by people in Peacehaven, Telscombe Cliffs, Saltdean, Rottingdean, Ovingdean and Brighton and Hove is treated to EU standards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new treatment works at Peacehaven is covered by a green roof equivalent in size to three football pitches, and is one of the largest in Europe, planted with downland grasses to help it blend into the surrounding landscape.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Peacehaven alone, more than one million cubic metres of earth was moved, all of which was reused on site as part of the extensive landscaping. The treatment works cover just one third of the construction site, the rest having been returned to agricultural land and a new park for the community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">MP for Brighton Kemptown and Peacehaven, Simon Kirby, was among guests taken on a tour of the Peacehaven works to mark the opening.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said: “This project is a remarkable feat of engineering. Peacehaven is a quarter of my constituency and I’m pleased that Southern Water has recognised the strong sense of community here. The company has worked with the councillors, with me as MP and with the residents to make sure that during the construction of this engineering achievement, the intrusion has been minimised.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other guests included Margaret Paren, Chairman of the Southern Downs National Park Authority, who described the new treatment works as a “fantastic facility” and particularly praised the use of downland grass on the roof.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She said: “What really impresses me is not only have you moulded it into the landscape, you have also moulded it into the biodiversity of the South Downs.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Richard Hodgson, Southern Water’s Project Manager for the scheme, said: “Thanks must also go to everyone who has worked on this scheme, whether in its planning, design, construction or operation. The team, including everyone who works for our supplier 4Delivery and the various specialist sub-contractors brought in, has been superb and helped deliver our biggest ever scheme on time and on budget.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Graham Sugrue, Costain’s Project Director, said: “I am delighted to have been involved in this project. When I first came here in 2009 it was just a field and to see the final product now gives me a real sense of personal achievement. Through all the challenges we encountered along the way, including objections from local residents and the severe snow in January 2010, it was essential that 4Delivery worked collaboratively with Southern Water to resolve the issues whilst minimising the impact on the programme.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Water Sector Director, Matt Crabtree, added: “I would like to congratulate Southern Water on its vision that has enabled this magnificent project. Working together, the Southern Water and 4D team has delivered an Award Winning scheme that not only blends in with the physical environment, but thanks to the team’s efforts, has been done in partnership with the local community.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The scheme was recently named Major Civil Engineering Project of the Year at the British Construction Industry Awards, beating other entries including The London 2012 Olympic Park Project.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">17 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain gave London residents a rare inside look at projects that will help ensure their lights stay on and improve their travelling experience in coming years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group opened up the National Grid – London Power Tunnels project and the Paddington Crossrail station site as part of Open Doors Weekend 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Open Doors is a UK-wide initiative that invites the public to visit a construction site in their area. It is the result of a partnership between UK Construction Group, CITB-Construction Skills, the Considerate Constructors Scheme and the Chartered Institute of Building.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It shows the career opportunities that construction has to offer and the range of skills that come together to make buildings and infrastructure part of our everyday lives.  It also demonstrates the importance of construction to both the national and regional economies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More than 20 organisations opened 75 sites across the country for the event.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Willesden Junction, west London, Costain opened up the National Grid Energy Education Centre, which explains the development of the energy system throughout the capital.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Centre usually provides tours for groups from schools, colleges and universities during term time, but is not normally open to the general public.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is driving three tunnels deep under London that will carry 400kV cables to provide the extra capacity for National Grid to ensure that power supplies are equal to the demands placed on them by householders and commerce beyond 2015. Costain has been tunnelling for two years now, with another year before completion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Residents from surrounding boroughs and further afield were able to take a tour and learn about the project, as well as the world of construction and tunnelling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Visitors could also step inside a mock-up of a section of tunnel at the centre, to give them some idea of the scale of the work that is going on every day beneath their feet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain and National Grid staff were on hand to explain the details of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It went very well,” said site Assistant Administration Manager, Patricia Walker. “People seemed generally intrigued and interested by what they saw.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Paddington, meanwhile, the Costain Skanska jv facilitated three visits, taking more than 60 guests through a journey of the construction with presentations from site engineers, a visit to site and then a demonstration of Building Information Modelling using the project’s multi-dimensional simulation room. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paddington Crossrail was, for the second year running, one of the first nationally to fill all of its allocated slots and extended its numbers to meet demand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The site visit took place using a raised pedestrian access, which provided an elevated view of the site and part of the underground excavation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Engineers Sam Reed and Richard Martin gave presentations to the groups, talking about their first-hand experiences and the complexity of the project. “It was great to support the Open Doors event and to be able to show people the exciting work that we do,” said Sam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It is not often that we have the opportunity show the general public our work before it is completed. This was a brilliant opportunity to showcase the work that we are so proud to be building.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">16 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Southern Water’s ‘Cleaner Seas for Sussex’ scheme, of which Costain and its 4Delivery partners were its principal contractors, recently scooped the Major Civil Engineering Project of the Year at the British Construction Industry Awards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The environmental scheme was awarded the accolade for projects over £50million. Designed and built by 4Delivery, which comprises Costain, MWH and Veolia Water, with Southern Water supported by Mott MacDonald and Turner &amp; Townsend in project delivery, the £300million scheme comprises of 11km of new sewer tunnel, two pumping stations, a wastewater treatment works at Peacehaven and a 2.5km long sea outfall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It took 12 years in planning, four years to build and will ensure the 95 million litres of wastewater produced each day by people in Peacehaven, Telscombe Cliffs, Saltdean, Rottingdean, Ovingdean and Brighton and Hove is treated to EU standards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The legacy, Bringing Cleaner Seas to Sussex, in a state-of-the art treatment works, covered by a green roof of over 18,000m<sup>2</sup> that blends in with the South Downs, is extremely rewarding from a pure civil engineering point of view. Being awarded the ‘Major Civil Engineering Project of the Year (over £50m)’ at the prestigious British Construction Industry Awards is the icing on the cake. It’s a real industry recognised award, for a project well delivered by all involved,” said Graham Sugrue, Costain’s Project Director.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The British Construction Industry Awards recognises overall excellence in the delivery of building and civil engineering infrastructure projects. The ceremony took place at the Grosvenor House Hotel, Park Lane, London.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">16 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Skanska JV (CSJV) has joined Crossrail’s campaign to make London’s roads safer by taking part in an Exchanging Places programme at the Mile End Park Leisure Centre.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two of CSJV’s subcontractors, Gordon and O’Donovan Waste Disposal, parked their heavy goods vehicles in the leisure centre coach parking bays created by CSJV as part of the contract enabling works. Visitors were then given the opportunity to sit in the driver’s seat to get a better understanding of what a lorry driver can and can’t see from their cab and where vehicle blind spots exist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The aim of the day was to raise awareness of safety requirements for vehicles, cyclists and pedestrians. Cyclists had free security marking, bicycle safety checks and hi-vis giveaways.  The day was a great success and everyone went away with a better understanding of the dangers associated with cycling on roads close to construction vehicles,” said Martin Griffiths, Costain Community Relations Manager working for CSJV on the Eleanor Street &amp; Mile End Shafts (Crossrail C360).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To offer greater protection to cyclists in London, Transport Minister Stephen Hammond, London Mayor Boris Johnson and London’s Transport Commissioner, Sir Peter Hendy CBE, recently announced a series of measures to improve cycle safety in London, including the enforcement of HGV standards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crossrail is leading the industry in heavy goods vehicle safety by requiring haulage contractors to fit additional safety equipment to their vehicles and for their regular drivers to undergo a one day training course. Crossrail’s road safety initiatives have the full support of all its principal contractors, including CSJV, who are fully committed to helping make London’s roads safer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a responsible company, Costain has also implemented a vulnerable road user’s initiative to tackle this key issue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company recently launched, and is implementing over the next 12 months, specific safety standards for vehicles travelling to and from its projects. The standards specify minimum requirements for driver competence and include safety measures that ensure the Company selects the safest travel route to and from the sites, minimising as much as possible the interface between construction vehicles and vulnerable road users.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company is also an active member of the Transport for London sub working group which is putting together a common code of practice that aims to encourage the wider adoption of best practice in construction logistics and cycle safety across industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Exchanging Places event highlighted the real dangers for cyclists and pedestrians on our roads, particularly in the centre of London where so much construction work is taking place, and the efforts being made by our industry to improve driver vision around their vehicles,” said Darren James, Costain’s Managing Director for Infrastructure, who was on site to give his support as part of a SHE Leadership Impact Day.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">15 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is promoting the implementation of a new technology that aims to provide a step-change in the way strain is measured in structures, delivering better data and therefore improvements in structural designs.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Cambridge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction (CSIC), an Innovation and Knowledge Centre at the University of Cambridge, has partnered with Costain to support an initiative to transfer knowledge and embed this technology in current Costain construction projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The UK’s ageing infrastructure requires monitoring and remedial interventions to extend life and prevent catastrophic failures. The high level of maintenance required to preserve these assets and run them at full capacity has created a demand for structural health monitoring and performance-based maintenance of legacy infrastructure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">‘Smart monitoring’ is an important assessment tool for delivering more efficient design and reducing over-specification.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Distributed Optical Fibre Strain Sensing is a technology that allows continuous strain measurement over an extended distance, with signals being sent along optical fibres attached to or embedded in structures. This technology can replace the use of large numbers of point sensors, such as vibrating wire strain gauges (VWSG).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This form of strain measurement helps improve understanding of the performance of tunnels and foundations during and after construction, and gives insight into the complex soil-structure interaction mechanisms involved, helping to identify localised problem areas, such as failure points.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has taken a lead in partnering with CSIC to incorporate this novel technology into current Costain projects.  A trial of the fibre-optic strain sensing technology is underway at the London Bridge Station project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fifteen Costain engineers and managers have attended training at CSIC, participating in lectures and workshops to understand the application of the technology and to use this knowledge to scope market opportunities for the technology. The first training session was held on 9 October.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aalok Sonawala, Business Improvement Manager, said: “This is a great initiative to bring technology from Cambridge’s CSIC to our projects, delivering technological innovations to meet and better our client expectations. The training will help us better manage the assets we build throughout their life cycle.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain involves CSIC at the project outset, facilitating project planning meetings with the Client to ensure objectives and deliverables are defined and agreeing on implementation plans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Philip Keenan, CSIC’s Business Development Manager, added: “This training forms part of the first phase of the Centre's aim to increase the UK construction industry's knowledge and understanding of the benefits of distributed strain sensing, using fibre optic strain sensing technology. The course delivered on 9th October included several case studies where we have delivered knowledge and new insights to construction projects using distributed fibre optic strain sensing.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">14 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Structures made from self-healing materials could soon be a significant step closer, thanks to Costain-sponsored research that begins next month. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three-year, £1.6 million Materials for Life (M4L) research project being carried out jointly by Cardiff, Cambridge and Bath Universities aims to develop concrete that can repair itself. Costain is one of the principal stakeholders in the project and is providing £600,000 of in kind funding. Other stakeholders include BRE, Highways Agency, The Welsh Government and Atkins. Costain is also sharing the financial support of research student Oliver Teall, Costain graduate civil engineer, who will carry out research leading to a PhD at Cardiff University.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The products developed will be trialled at a number of Costain sites. The location of the trials is yet to be decided but it is expected that they will begin in Spring 2015 and last approximately 18 months. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is cutting edge technology and Costain’s involvement once again underlines our commitment to innovation,” said Andrea Green, Project Manager. “Self-healing concrete could be a game changer for the industry, with the potential to enhance durability, improve safety and dramatically reduce maintenance costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain is bringing funding to the project and also our expertise in managing projects, commercial management, product development and access to key national clients for site trials.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oliver will be looking at how shape memory polymers can be used to help heal cracks in concrete.  He explained: “Polymer tendons are incorporated into the concrete. If a crack occurs, these tendons can currently be activated by either heat or an electrical supply. They then spring back to their original shape, compressing the concrete and closing the crack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He added: “Researchers at Bath and Cambridge will be looking at calcite producing bacteria and microcapsules that contain healing agents respectively.  The aim is to combine all three areas of research to create multi-scale damage immunity and pave the way for a new generation of construction materials.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oliver will divide his time between Cardiff University and Costain’s Cardiff offices.  He said he jumped at the chance to be involved in the project.  “It’s not only an opportunity to develop something new; it’s a chance to develop products that can be used on a global scale and provide exciting new solutions for our customers.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Added Andrea: “In Oliver we will have someone who has carried out cutting edge research and then brought that knowledge back into the business, further enhancing our leading innovation credentials.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">10 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, eight major UK construction companies announce that they are working together to develop a scheme to compensate construction workers whose names were on The Consulting Association (TCA) database.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The companies - Balfour Beatty, Carillion, Costain, Kier, Laing O’Rourke, Sir Robert McAlpine, Skanska UK and VINCI PLC - all apologise for their involvement with TCA and the impact that its database may have had on any individual construction worker.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The companies have joined together to establish The Construction Workers Compensation Scheme. The scheme is intended to make it as simple as possible for any worker with a legitimate claim to access compensation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The companies have invited workers' representatives to enter into a period of engagement to ensure that the proposed terms of the scheme are fair and effective. The group is also engaging with other interested parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At this time we are not able to share any further information on the proposed scheme. However, once engagement with the workers' representatives has concluded, we will announce full details of the scheme which we would like to open to applicants as soon as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have discussed the scheme with a number of other construction companies. We encourage participation from across the industry and would welcome interest from any company that had been a user of, or subscriber to, TCA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The companies involved in the scheme would support the introduction of a code of conduct to ensure nothing like this can happen within the construction industry again.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">9 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Local students have gained a taste of the construction industry at the new Paddington Crossrail station site, with contractors Costain Skanska JV providing two paid internships.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The two sixth form college students from Paddington Academy are part of a science academy scheme run by Careers Academy UK, aiming to attract students into science related careers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contractors were invited to take part with the science academy which included site visits, mentoring and paid six week internships over the course of the academic year.  The science academy was supported by a number of large businesses, including Astra Zeneca, Marks and Spencer, Imperial College London, John Laing and many others.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following a site visit to the Paddington construction site in December 2012 some of the students were inspired to apply for the two internships, with the commercial and engineering teams providing support functions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The internships lasted for six weeks with one extended to eight weeks at the request of the student.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Andy Mooney, Costain Skanska JV Construction Manager said: “The construction industry has a responsibility to inspire and help train the next generation of engineers. It has been a real pleasure to see these local youngsters getting involved with our project and by giving them real responsibilities within our team they have developed their skills.  The project team has really got behind the work experience and intern programme this summer and my thanks goes out to them."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The feedback from the students was extremely positive with one of the students, Osama, saying: “Before this internship if someone would have asked me if I wanted to go into construction I would have been unsure, but after this wonderful experience I can easily answer this question by saying ‘definitely’.  So thank you all for guiding me in the right direction.” </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the completion of the academic year, all of the students that took part presented to the supporting organisations about their experiences. Andy, who attended, said: “I was particularly impressed with the confidence of these young people, they really did put on a good show and in front of an audience of high level professions.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">8 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain recently hosted a Health &amp; Safety Seminar in London to explain how a company’s health and safety performance can create a positive health and safety culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The seminar, which took place at law firm Clyde &amp; Co. was organised by Gary Mills, a Director in Costain Asset Management, and Neal Kennedy, a Safety, Health and Environment Manager. The event brought together some of Costain’s equity partners, including Laing, Equitix, Amber Infrastructure and Babcock International, to listen to presentations on current health and safety legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The speakers included Keith Morton QC, an expert in health, safety and regulatory law; Victor Rae-Reeves, a Partner at Clyde &amp; Co specialising in complex litigation cases in the construction and engineering sector, and Alan Cheung who talked about Costain’s own Behavioural Management Programme, which includes Costain Behavioural Safety (CBS), and how it has been used to successfully drive improvements in the Company’s health and safety performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The aim of the session was to get as many of our equity partners together to focus on health and safety from a legal perspective. We wanted to use the wealth of experience on offer to highlight how good practice by a board of directors can help to ensure that a company’s health and safety performance can help to create a positive health and safety culture,” said Gary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gary added: “The companies present are generally involved in the delivery of facilities management services for schools and hospitals. Keith and Victor carefully explained the complex legal landscape and the responsibilities that are placed on company directors. The introduction to behavioural management was also a new concept for many of the attendees and Alan provided a fast moving and interactive session for our partners.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CBS has been used to create environments where, through leadership and the provision of timely and appropriate consequences, everyone in the Company - from directors to the workforce - understands the importance of taking responsibility for their own safety and the safety of those around them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The seminar was such a success that other events are being planned in the future to encompass other areas of the building, construction and maintenance business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The feedback from the seminar has been excellent. It was well attended and we have already received requests to run a similar session in the future but expanded to include some of our Facilities Management delivery partners,” said Gary.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">3 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has completed the task of delivering the last major module to be installed at Sellafield’s Evaporator D, the UK’s largest nuclear project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Measuring 27 metres long x 7 metres wide x 12 metres high and weighing around 525 tonnes, ‘Module 920’ was safely landed on a beach near Sellafield on 24th September before travelling to an offloading position at the Evaporator D site on 25th September. Evaporator D, or EVAP D, is a new highly Active Liquor Evaporation operating unit that will provide additional evaporator capacity for the treatment of nuclear waste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Module 920 contains two of the main vessels that are required for evaporation, housing over 5,000 metres of high integrity stainless steel piping as well as 23 vessels that have been constructed and installed to meet exacting nuclear quality standards.  Completion of the module has involved the efforts of 150 people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The safe delivery of Module 920 is a huge milestone for the project and we are delighted to receive this critical piece of infrastructure which will now allow us to focus our efforts on completing the project,” said Rob Phillips, EVAP D’s Programme Director.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The logistical challenges started on 15th September when Module 920 was transported from its assembly plant for a mile-long journey to Manesty Wharf in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. As the module is so big, the team used a 256-wheel Self-Propelled Modular Transporter with two V10 500 horsepower truck engines to move it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the quayside, the laden transporter was driven on board a multipurpose pontoon, the MPP Terra Marique, and secured over several days in preparation for the 19 hour journey by sea to Sellafield, where the pontoon then made a beach landing adjacent to the site. Transferring such an enormous piece of equipment posed significant challenges for the team, not least the changeable weather.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The weather conditions for sailing and moving the module had to be particularly favourable – the wind had to be below Force 5 and the waves on the beach no higher than 0.5m,” said Rob.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In total, Costain has designed, procured and delivered 11 modules to the EVAP D building.  With it being too big to be transported by road or rail, EVAP D has been constructed using the modularisation method, where each module has been constructed off-site and transported by sea. This is the first use of modularisation for a process plant on the Sellafield site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To get the modules from the beach to the site, the team had to construct temporary beach access, a temporary bridge across a tidal area and an enormous gantry to lift and then fit the modules into place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The beach was prepared with a portable aluminium roadway which allowed the transporter to drive off the pontoon and over the beach across the River Ehan and then via a short section of public highway onto the site,” Rob said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the installation of Module 920, work will start on completing the 1,200 welds that will then allow inactive commissioning of the plant to commence. Before the site is handed over for active commissioning in 2016, the team now faces the challenge of completing the cable installation and control system.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">3 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has brought together some of industry’s top names to tackle the problem of youth unemployment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event, called The Big Infrastructure Conversation, was held at London’s City Hall recently in conjunction with Business in the Community*, the UK’s largest business-led charity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Students from St Augustine’s CoE High School, ambassadors from The Prince’s Trust and apprentices and trainees from various blue-chip companies met business leaders and discussed their own apprenticeship experiences and the importance of inspirational work experience.  Among the presenters on the day were Terry Morgan CBE, Chairman of Crossrail and Steve Holliday, Chief Executive of National Grid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The students and apprentices heard, through presentations and round table discussions, about the importance of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math’s) skills, and why traineeships and apprenticeships are so important to the UK’s infrastructure needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A lack of skills has pushed youth unemployment above 1 million. According to the Department of Work and Pensions, between April and June 2013, there were 1.09 million young people not in work, education or training, roughly equivalent to 15% of people under the age of 25.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inspiring young people to want to gain STEM skills is vital if industry wants to meet future demands, as more young people with these skills can be matched to the skills that business want and need.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the industry leaders, there was also an opportunity to share best practice about how businesses can tackle youth unemployment and to listen to young people about their needs, hopes and ambitions for the future, particularly in relation to securing valuable career advice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ‘Big Conversation’ is the initiative from Business in the Community through which it engages with the business community and young people. Since 2009, over 26 Big Conversations have been delivered nationwide covering all areas of work and industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Business in the Community’s ambition is that everyone, particularly those with significant barriers to overcome, receives support from business, to build the skills and confidence they need to gain and sustain employment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Investing in young people and helping the industry address the long-term skills shortage is an integral component of Costain Cares and Engineering Tomorrow, Costain’s commitment to identifying, developing and implementing innovative solutions to meet the UK’s major national infrastructure needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Cares underpins Costain’s role as an active member of Business in the Community by supporting its goal of creating jobs and helping every young person, particularly those facing social disadvantage, to receive support from business to build a successful working life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain Cares is firmly committed to Business in the Community’s aim of supporting young people to gain a foothold in the construction industry, and we need to engage with young people as they are closer to knowing what the challenges and opportunities are going to be in the future. But promoting STEM skills isn’t just about social responsibility, it also makes good business sense as we can attract the best and brightest talent into our companies,” said Catherine Warbrick, Costain’s Director for Corporate Responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You too can join the Big Conversation by following the debate on Twitter @thebiginfraconv and at @BITC1.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Business in the Community stands for responsible business. It is a unique business movement - the largest business-led charity of its kind - committed to building resilient communities, diverse workplaces and a more sustainable future. The charity works locally, nationally and internationally with its members to transform businesses and transform communities. It believes that responsible leadership is the ability to balance doing both.<br />BITC asks its members to work with it on specific campaigns that impact in the workplace, marketplace and community.  It offers a range of services that challenge, support and inspire members and help transform their businesses.  Business in the Community (BITC) <a href="http://www.bitc.org.uk/">www.bitc.org.uk</a></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">1 October 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Reading Station Area Redevelopment project has reached a number of milestones, speeding up the completion of the project and improving the travelling experience for commuters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Platform 11 – the platform which caters for the busy Reading to Paddington route – officially opened to the public on August Bank Holiday weekend, while Platform 10, which was built in just three days over Christmas 2011, has now been removed to allow for its permanent construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All this work means Platform 10 should be back in action by February 2014, some 10 months ahead of schedule. With work being completed ahead of schedule, buildings at the east end of platforms 8, 9, 10 and 11, as well as the refurbishment of platform 9, should be completed by 2014, said Brian Fisher, the Project Director.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Improvements at the station include building new platforms and entrances, lengthening platforms to create room for longer trains, constructing new platform canopies and creating better waiting room and customer information facilities. That means there’s a lot of construction material still to shift.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Platforms 8, 9 and 10 are now under construction but because they are island platforms – or positioned between two tracks – the team has to get over 10,000 tonnes of material to the platforms and get over 5,000 tonnes of demolition and excavated material away from the site,” Brian said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The upgrades to the station are one part of Network Rail’s £895 million investment to transform the railway in Reading. It is one of the busiest parts of the country’s rail network and its complicated track layout constricts the number of trains that can run.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To help unblock the bottle-neck on the railway, Network Rail is building a new 2km viaduct to the west of the station which will improve journeys for thousands of passengers who use the Western Main Line every day. The original aim was to complete work by the end of 2016 but now work is scheduled to finish by the end of 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the station is a major junction on the national rail system, dealing with around 800 trains and up to 45,000 commuters each day, an ongoing challenge for the team is trying to keep the amount of disruption for commuters to a minimum.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are always trying to keep the platforms open as much as possible, but the only time there are no trains is between 01.00 and 05.00 and, even between these hours, both freight trains and engineering trains are still running, so it’s quite a logistical challenge for us,” said Brian.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">26 September 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has markedly increased the number of graduates it has employed this summer, reflecting the continuing expansion of the Group’s portfolio of activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Normally Costain recruits around 45 university graduates annually. This year, the number has risen to 62, an increase of roughly 38%.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“As the Company is changing and evolving, we’re seeking a more diverse range of talent,” explains Graduate Development Officer, Camilla Duncan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“New disciplines we’ve taken on this year include English and Business Management graduates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Historically, we’ve been very much focused on civil engineering, but now we’re focusing on increasing our mechanical and electrical engineering capability.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This year, graduates have come from no fewer than 13 different disciplines and have been allocated to posts across all the Group’s divisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finding some categories of graduates is easier than others, says Camilla. “We’re very much established with civil engineering and quantity surveying graduates and are an employer of choice for them.” Attracting graduates in Costain’s newer areas of interest means fighting with other potential employers to get the right calibre of next-generation staff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, a further 51 students undertaking higher education qualifications are coming to the end of their summer placements with the Company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They typically spend eight to 10 weeks of their summer vacation working on Costain sites to give them a taste of the industry and hopefully to encourage them to take up employment with the Company when they graduate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They are sponsored through university by way of bursaries and are assessed for Costain’s graduate programme as they complete their educational careers.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">25 September 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A building that documents the march of evolution was, appropriately, the site for a Costain event that highlighted the latest innovations the Company is accelerating to market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Darwin Centre in London’s Natural History Museum was host venue to a Customer Innovations Evening last night [Tuesday 24 September], showcasing exciting products and developments that the Group has brought to fruition over the past year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The audience consisted of over 60 customers and key stakeholders, who were able to talk to the Costain personnel behind the innovations, discovering the benefits of individual innovations and how they could improve the performance of their business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event demonstrated Costain’s Engineering Tomorrow strategy in action, which focuses on identifying, developing and implementing innovative solutions to the unmet needs of our customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We had over 30 innovation leaders from around the business demonstrating various innovations we’ve been developing.  This included advanced process technology, power generation, remote monitoring of assets, workforce management and talent development,” said Group Innovation and Knowledge Manager, Tim Embley, who organised the event.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A keynote speech from Group Technical and Operations Director, Alan Kay, set the scene and stressed the importance of innovation in creating a sustainable future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The evening was very successful, we have received positive feedback and are now organising meetings with our customers to explore how we can incorporate more innovation in their operation," said Alan. "This provides an opportunity to demonstrate how we work closely with our customers, increase the range of new services we provide.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Hosted by Darren James, Costain’s Managing Director for Infrastructure, the day welcomed nearly 100 people from all levels of the Group to understand how leading high performance can support the Company’s commitment to developing Engineering Tomorrow, the Costain strategy to develop innovative solutions that will help customers make a step change in their business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Inspired by Formula One motor racing, the attendees were asked to consider how, through leadership driving innovation and teamwork, they can achieve high performance in their chosen field.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The delegates heard from Professor Richard Parry-Jones CBE, the Chairman of Network Rail, who inspired the delegates about the importance of leadership in transforming culture to deliver high performance for customers; and Professor Mark Jenkins from the Cranfield School of Management, who challenged the delegates to use lessons from Formula One to drive innovation, competitive strategy and teamwork.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Engineering Tomorrow is focused on harnessing new and innovative technological solutions. The strategy, which was launched in February, has already delivered valuable solutions and the attendees heard from a number of Costain’s leaders about how innovation and team work are making a difference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Project Manager, Joe Rice-Jones, gave a presentation on Mario (Mass Asset Recognition and Intelligent Optimisation), the Company’s innovative asset management tool which gives customers a cost-effective and accurate picture of the condition of their infrastructure assets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dr Bryony Livesey, a Research and Technology Manager, spoke about Plasma Vitrification and Graphite Gasification, two innovative technologies that have the potential to save billions of pounds in the storage, management and disposal of low and intermediate nuclear waste; while Catherine Warbrick, Costain’s Corporate Responsibility Director, gave a presentation on Plotr, an online careers advice platform for young people which, in line with Costain Cares, is increasing the Company’s focus on helping young people gain a foothold in the engineering and construction industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lastly, James Forward, a Development Manager at Costain, gave a talk about Path Intelligence, a unique footfall mapping technology which can help to help solve problems facing the travel and transport industries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone at the event had the opportunity to put their teamwork skills to the test. The delegates were split into eight teams and given the task of taking part in a Williams’ F1 Pitstop Challenge. Against the clock, the teams experienced first-hand just what it is like to change a Formula One tyre using the same equipment that Grand Prix teams use around the world. The day culminated in a head to head between the two fastest teams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the day, Costain’s Darren James, said: “Through working together on an exciting practical exercise, and being inspired by our guest speakers and people from Costain, everyone present identified how, through leadership, we can drive high performance through a culture of innovation and teamwork.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">19 September 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">National Grid’s London Power Tunnels project team has excelled in the latest assessment by the Considerate Constructors Scheme (CCS) by achieving a score of 42 out of a possible 50. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project scored eight and nine out of 10 in the five areas measured which included; enhancing the appearance, respecting the community, protecting the environment, securing everyone’s safety and caring for the workforce. A score of eight in any category shows excellent measures are in place, while nine acknowledges the exceptional measures implemented.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Exceptional scores were awarded for 'Caring for the Workforce' and 'Respecting the Community', which demonstrates the projects’ exemplary commitment that 'Costain Cares'. The project demonstrated the very highest level of achievement through: encouragement of new people into the industry by young offender’s scheme, extensive engagement with the 10 local authority environmental health officials, inviting local cafe’s to manage site canteens, detailed traffic management plan, newsletters and face-to-face community drop-in sessions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the site, Chris Magee, the CCS Monitor, said: “This large scale project continues to promote an above excellent impression with its presence in several locations within the London area. The contractor continues to be very much a team player in all community link issues and initiatives used to communicate progress of the project to the community. Excellent promotion of the environmental and safety processes continues as the project progresses in various locations with exceptional results being maintained. The highest standard of operative facilities and feedback is provided by a very focused and informed site management team."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Andy Firth, Project Manager, received the beyond performance certificate on behalf of the project and expressed delight on the team’s contribution to the improved scores compared with the 40 received following the last audit in April 2013. </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">17 September 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Costain-organised conference put the spotlight on using an increasingly popular technology to improve site health and safety.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Building Information Modelling (BIM) allows a project’s planners, designers and construction team to progressively add information about the job to an electronic database as it progresses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The background to the conference was an approach by a Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE) official to SHE Director, Peter Fisher, “who asked me what we were doing on BIM in regards to safety. I put him in touch with Matt Blackwell, who has been leading on BIM and has done all the hard work to get it to this stage.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a result, said Head of BIM, Matt: “Several months ago, HSE officials came to see me, to talk about BIM and how we could use it to improve safety performance and mitigate against risk.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We suggested holding a conference on the subject and they said ‘Great. Go ahead and organise it!’”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After much work behind the scenes, the ‘BIM for health and safety’ event took place at the Institution of Structural Engineers’ headquarters in London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Determined to make the event memorable, Matt and his colleague Melanie Dyer created a ‘speed-dating’ format for the conference. A timer gave each speaker just 15 minutes to put across  their presentation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, Matt and Melanie made extensive use of the internet to organise the event: “We relied quite heavily on social media to publicise it, drum up attendees and find speakers,” he explained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The tactic worked well: over six hours, 19 speakers gave their ideas on how to use BIM to make workplaces safer. “We had contractors, consultants, supply chain, plus a lot of universities presenting research,” he said. “The idea was that people would take something away from the day and use their own site to use the ideas to prevent injuries or deaths.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We were quite conscious of not making it seem like a Costain marketing exercise,” added Matt. “The Construction Industry Council allowed us to ‘badge’ it with their name and gave us a lot of support.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Feedback has been universally excellent and other people are now looking to adopt this ‘speed-dating’ approach.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Technical Director, Bill Hewlett, agreed the event had been very successful: “People were invited on the basis that they would give a presentation. The ‘entry price’ was to be a BIM practitioner and to have something that you were prepared to contribute and were happy to share for everyone’s benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We obviously feel very strongly about health and safety, have a growing interest in BIM and wanted to support best practice in health and safety.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Added Peter: “The HSE has subsequently spoken to me about how pleased they are with Matt’s engagement and help.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">11 September 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s current drive to improve the health &amp; wellbeing of its workforce will be accelerating during October with a week-long company-wide campaign focussing on how to maintain a healthy heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Heart disease kills more people in the UK than any other disease. The campaign will be run during week commencing 14 October and there will be a specific theme for each day, including diet, exercise, alcohol levels and how to recognise the signs of a heart attack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Posters and fact sheets have been produced to support the campaign which will highlight simple changes we can all make to our lifestyle to help us maintain a healthy heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The health of our workforce is very important to us and has formed an integral part of our Costain Cares initiative”, said Veronica Robins, Costain's Health &amp; Wellbeing Manager. “I do hope that all staff will take advantage of the campaign and attend the short presentations that will be held each day."  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sessions are optional but will provide everyone with the opportunity to find out ways in which they can improve the health of themselves and their loved ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The healthy heart campaign will be the latest in a number of wellbeing initiatives implemented over the last four years and the second of 2013.  The first initiative of the year was the Costain Pedometer Challenge, aimed at encouraging the workforce to become active in a fun and sociable way.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">10 September 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain MWH framework team working on the Minworth Sewage Works with Severn Trent Water has excelled in the latest assessment by the Considerate Constructors Scheme (CCS).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The success of any project is greatly dependent on working with stakeholders to ensure that the construction site runs as smoothly as possible and progress is being made to bring the project to completion. As part of that process, the CCS aims to improve the image of construction by assessing and monitoring sites against a code of practice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team achieved a score of 42 out of a possible 50, securing scores of eight or nine out of 10 in the five areas measured which included enhancing the appearance, respecting the community, protecting the environment, securing everyone’s safety and caring for the workforce. A score of eight in any category shows excellent measures are in place, while a nine acknowledges the exceptional measures are being taken in that category.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team achieved exceptional scores in ‘respecting the community’ and ‘securing everyone’s safety’, reflecting the positive influence Costain’s Behavioural Safety programme has had on everyone’s attitude towards health and safety, and the team’s outstanding outreach work with schools and colleges through the Costain Skills Academy, said Andy Mellor, the Site Agent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Minworth is Severn Trent Water’s largest sewage works and the second largest in the UK. It serves a population of 1.7 million people within the Birmingham and Black Country area but treats sludge from a population equivalent of 2.5 million due to the large volume of imports it receives from the surrounding areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The current AMP5 phase of investment is due to deliver an Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive to further reduce phosphorous levels in the River Tame by September 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the site, Barry Brettell, the CCS Monitor, said: “It is always good to visit a site where, although achieving an excellent standard on my first visit, have successfully endeavoured to further explore and improve on the high level of service already achieved.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Barry also noted the worthwhile links established with the wider community to be of very high standard, with particular encouragement for students to consider construction as a career option.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Andy Mellor added: “We are delighted with our latest CCS score and the Monitor’s comments, which reflect the sense of ownership and shared responsibility we enjoy across the whole team. It’s been great to have everyone involved in welcoming young people to site to motivate and inspire them to consider construction as a genuine career choice for the future.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">9 September 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is using the latest mobile technology that takes advantage of its cloud platforms to develop innovative smartphone and tablet device applications for use across its operations, which could potentially help to save time and money on its projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s MobiCloud applications address a broad range of construction issues, such as managing safety permits, access to policies and site procedures, incident reporting and asset management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The initiative is supported by the European Commission’s MobiCloud project, a corporate appstore which contains applications, or apps, which are connected to a cloud-hosted platform and which allows users to access, store and analyse large amounts of data. Cloud computing is a general term for anything that involves delivering a hosted service over a secure internet connection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first MobiCloud application to be deployed by Costain is a tablet-based site diary, which records every event that takes place on a construction site, thus replacing the need for the current paper-based records system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mark Collier, a Graduate Civil Engineer, said: “Wherever you can save time on site will have a direct benefit to safety and quality by allowing an engineer more time to monitor site work. This extra productivity, and therefore cost saving, can then also be passed back to our customers.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jason Scott, a consultant for COMIT, an industry association which promotes the use of mobile technologies in construction, said: “The MobiCloud site diary enables Costain to quickly search for the relevant records and matching pictures, but also to make sure that the information is more accurately documented by its engineers.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting, Tim Embley, Group Innovation &amp; Knowledge Manager at Costain, added: “Costain has a commitment to innovation and the application of new technology. MobiCloud enables us to explore how mobile and cloud technology can help us to improve our operations and deliver better service to our customers. Following the deployment of the MobiCloud site diary, we continue to develop more apps that continue to enhance the services we provide to our customers.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The MobiCloud consortium is led by Appear (Sweden) and includes Nettropolis (Germany), EsperantoXL (the Netherlands), Costain (UK) and COMIT Projects (UK). The MobiCloud Partner Program allows any organization to access an infrastructure to develop and run its own corporate appstore, or evaluate an existing MobiCloud application.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">6 September 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain makes its 'blogging' debut on the Company website today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain blog will increase further the level of two-way dialogue between the Company and its stakeholders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’re always looking for new ways to engage with stakeholders and a massive element about Costain Cares is how we get feedback so we’re not just going off and doing what we, as a business, feel is right,” said Corporate Responsibility Director, Catherine Warbrick.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“News releases and the website tend to be one-way communication, whereas the idea of a blog is to encourage more discussion and communication. We’re looking for what our stakeholders think we should be prioritising.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stakeholders will be able to ‘share’ blog entries and post comments on the new webpage which will be hosted within the Responsibility area of the website, with a link on the homepage.  It is hoped that these comments will grow into a discussion forum.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new blog will be run through the Communications Department. “We want to embrace all new channels in Social Media and the Costain blog is an additional way of engaging with our stakeholders on a variety of topics,” said Social Media Officer, Donna Bowden.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We look forward to receiving visitors’ comments and views.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Likely topics will include aspects of Costain Cares, SHE, environmental sustainability and skills. Specialists from throughout the Company will be encouraged to put forward contributions, rather than the bulk of the material originating in the Communications Department.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">5 September 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A ‘Fantasy Football League’-style scheme for good ideas is stimulating creativity among the Costain team on the Heathrow Airport programme of works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain's strategy 'Engineering Tomorrow' is driving innovation forward as a way of delivering business excellence to clients. Since the end of last year an ‘innovation league table’ showing the top innovators has been on the wall at the Heathrow office.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The league is a platform for the team to share its ideas and best practice from one project to another on the Heathrow framework and throughout Costain’s supply chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Divya Gupta, Costain Heathrow Innovation Champion, explains: “Think of it as a kind of fantasy football league for ideas, except that the ideas are real and so are the achievements.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Points are given for the introduction of an idea (1 pt), implementation of the idea (2 pts) and the success of the idea (2 pts). The league is also open to the supply chain and employees of Heathrow Airport who wish to participate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To put forward an idea, they fill in a template detailing their suggestion and the benefits it may bring in areas such as costs or health and safety.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are no prizes for coming up with ideas, but seeing their names on the leader board has been very motivating in encouraging suggestions, said Gupta, a Graduate Civil Engineer. Fellow Graduate Civil Engineer, Karin Jones, administers the ‘league’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It definitely encourages the flow of ideas,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Best practice and innovative ideas are shared with Heathrow and other stakeholders at monthly contractor quality meetings at the airport.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ideas are certainly doing no harm when it comes to Costain’s traditional focus on health and safety excellence. The Costain Airports Sector Team secured two RoSPA Gold Awards this year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The awards recognised the success of initiatives like Costain Behavioural Safety, where everyone in the business – from employees, customers and the supply chain – understands the importance of taking responsibility not only for their own safety but also for the safety of those around them.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">4 September 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s commitment to improving skills, safety and engagement with schools has been underlined once again in results from the first year of the Construction Skills Academy on Severn Trent Water’s AMP5 Framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It hit 90% of the key performance indicators set by the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB), leaving the first-year  target of 80% achievement trailing in its wake.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Framework team, led by Project Skills Co-ordinator Sarah Allez, achieved 75 of the 82 targets set and monitored by the CITB. In total, 6,500 hours of training were undertaken by Costain and subcontract staff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One requirement, to put four subcontractors through advanced health and safety training, was eclipsed as no fewer than 42 subcontractors completed either the CITB’s Site Management Safety Training Scheme or Site Supervisor Safety Training Scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A further 213 undertook other accredited training courses, helping to improve further the safety of everyone working on Costain sites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another CITB requirement, for 24 pupils undertaking a construction or STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering or Maths) subject to be involved in a construction-based activity led by Costain, was also broken when 34 pupils participated in a Construction Careers Day at Buxton Community School,  Derbyshire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alison Trick, the school’s Careers Education and Guidance Co-ordinator, said: “The students greatly appreciated the presentations you gave and were very enthusiastic participants in the Lego Tower activity, giving them the opportunity to think about the skills needed on construction projects from planning to problem solving. Feedback from students has been extremely positive.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CITB also set a target for the Framework to reach higher education students by opening sites to at least four individuals. Together, Minworth and Edgbaston hosted 40.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Framework staff also reached a further 185 pupils with careers talks and by providing information about the construction industry, through a combination of volunteering as  Construction Ambassadors and supporting the Big Bang Science and Engineering Fair in June.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the Skills Academy moves into its second year the focus will be on increasing NVQ qualifications, recruiting apprentices, increasing supply chain engagement and forging stronger links with schools and colleges.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the first year’s results, Framework Director Ritchie Burcombe, said: “We’ve got off to a flying start and really set the tone for the next couple of years with regard to increasing the skills set of our own workforce and that of our supply chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I’m particularly pleased to see how many staff are engaging with the skills programme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I want to challenge all Framework staff to look at how they can support Sarah and colleagues over the next twelve months to ensure our Academy status and performance continue to go from strength to strength.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">2 September 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has underlined its continued commitment to sustainable development by signing up to the Welsh Government’s Sustainable Development Charter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Signing the Charter is a voluntary commitment to making sustainability central to business, promoting and delivering environmental, social and economic wellbeing through decisions and operations and sharing the learning from that journey. So far more than 150 organisations, big and small, from a range of sectors across Wales have joined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Sustainability is a cornerstone of Costain Cares – our commitment to meeting the needs of our clients, communities, employees and stakeholders,” said Barry Woodman, Costain Programme Director. “By signing up to the Charter we’re demonstrating our commitment to putting sustainable development at the core of everything we do and to continue to deliver sustainable solutions. We’re also challenging ourselves to do things differently, and agreeing to share best practice to support sustainable development.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">David Fitzpatrick, Chief Executive of Cynnal Cymru-Sustain Wales, which manages the Charter on behalf of Welsh Government, welcomed Costain to the network of Charter signatories. “Costain is an innovative organisation with a strong reputation for sustainability.  In joining the network, Costain’s broad range of good practice examples can be shared with other organisations across Wales.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Signatories within the Charter network share best practice through forums and events, fostering innovation, development and collaboration to develop new ideas and support sustainable development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Barry added: “These innovations can then be fed back into the business and shared with other stakeholders to improve sustainability throughout the industry.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>29 August 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The latest milestone in Costain’s £200 million contract on National Grid’s London Power Tunnels project, which is being constructed with Skanska, has been reached eight days ahead of schedule.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On 15 August tunnel boring machine (TBM) Evelyn broke through into a pre-prepared shaft at Wimbledon, southwest London, completing a 3km-long drive from Wandsworth in just four months. It completes the latest stage in the creation of 32km of tunnels being built to house a new generation of 400kV electricity cables under London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is certainly the safest and the quickest tunnelling contract I’ve ever worked on,” said Angus Mackenzie, Tunnelling Agent. “To date, in over 10.5 km of 3m internal diameter tunnel constructed we have incurred only one minor LTI (lost time injury) and have increased our productivity levels to being able to maintain a consistent 60-plus metres per day.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Extensive planning and a robust preventative maintenance regime were key, along with a very positive behavioural safety culture amongst the entire site team. Said Angus: “We made sure we had identified and analyzed where previous shortcomings had occurred throughout the system and made modifications to ensure they didn’t happen again.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the biggest technical challenges on this drive was a curve in the tunnel alignment that had a tight 22.5 metre radius. “This gave us issues with the pit bottom as the drive shaft was centred on this curve but, using a combination of experience and new ideas, we were able to design around this,” said Angus.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lennart Stenman, Construction Director, praised Angus and his “very organised” team: “They’ve done a great job completing eight days ahead of programme, managing the operational and technical aspects of the job safely.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Evelyn is now being dismantled and split up into her principal component parts to be inspected and refurbished ready for her next and final drive on this project: 9km from Wandsworth to Kensal Green in northwest London – this is the longest drive on the 3m id section of the project and takes the tunnel under the River Thames. This will begin at the end of October and is due to be completed by the end of 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile Evelyn’s ‘sister’ TBM, Cleopatra, is hard at work on the contract’s other 13km tunnel which runs from St John’s Wood in the west of the capital to Hackney in the east. Cleopatra has recently begun her second drive from the Eade Road drive site in Haringey to Hackney.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contract is due to be complete by 2014, with full energisation of the new cables planned by November 2018.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>28 August 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain Industrial Cooling Team working on the Energy-from-Waste (EfW) plant on Teesside has been awarded a Contractor of the Month safety award for achieving a consistently high safety performance on the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The award, which was presented by the principal contractor Foster Wheeler, consists of a trophy that is retained for a month and a cheque for £500 which goes to a charity chosen by the team.  The chosen charity was Macmillan Cancer Support.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Industrial Cooling is currently constructing a new four cell Counterflow Water Cooling Tower as part of the world’s largest renewable energy plant being built in the UK using advanced gasification EfW technology on Teesside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The objective of the works is to provide sufficient cooling performance for the site, using the latest cooling technology to minimise environmental impact and maximise thermal performance efficiency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cooling tower is being constructed using a framework of Glass Reinforced Plastic GRP and associated fixings such as distribution pipes drift eliminator and pack media.  The work involves managing key risks such as working at height, the use of cranes and manual handling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting, Mark Blackham, Managing Director for Industrial Cooling, said: “The award is thoroughly deserved for the consistent proactive safety attitude the team has shown and will significantly assist in securing future work for the next phase of the project.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>27 August 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Harbour Way project team has won the Constructing Excellence In Wales Award for Integration and Collaborative Working.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The £107m scheme, jointly funded by the Welsh Government and European Regional Development Fund, which began in 2009 and is due to complete in the autumn this year, involves the construction of 4.5km of new dual carriageway on what was derelict and contaminated land. Two new site entrances had to be built for the Tata steelworks and the project team had to work with Network Rail on the construction of a new bridge over the main Swansea to London railway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Project participants include the client, Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council <br />(NPT CBC), lead contractor Costain, Arup and key supply chain partners. Given the multitude of organisations involved, a remarkable degree of integration was achieved by the project team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The judges felt that a clear strategy and commitment from key stakeholders had enabled the impressive degree of integration achieved on the project, encouraging everyone involved to buy in to the project’s values and vision. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is a great achievement for us, and testament to our ongoing efforts in working together as one team focused on the successful delivery of Harbour Way,” said Costain’s Project Manager, John Skentelbery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Councillor Ali Thomas, Leader of NPT CBC, said: "I warmly congratulate Costain on being recognised in this way and I wish them every success in the national awards.  It is no surprise to me that they have won this accolade because this project has been an excellent example of working in partnership with and on behalf of the community.  This is one of the biggest projects this area has seen and Costain deserve a lot of credit for the way in which they have gone about it."</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">23 August 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has secured a one year extension to an Operations and Maintenance contract at Fiddlers Ferry Fuel Services for SSE.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contract comprises the operations and maintenance of the furnace bottom ash systems, electrostatic precipitators, flue gas desulphurisation plant, industrial cleaning and facilities management of commercial cleaning fire services, grounds maintenance and catering. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has been instrumental in optimising its range of services and overlapping its core offering across a range of specialisms.  This has allowed the Company to deliver added value throughout the last five year term and display a flexible, open book approach to managing costs, said Tony McKeown, Costain’s Senior Operations Manager at Fiddlers Ferry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are delighted to be given a contract extension with SSE. Our ability to continually deliver our services with a stable workforce of over 100 site-based permanent staff, working in a safe and efficient manner, has allowed Costain to continue supporting the Operations, Maintenance and Facilities at Fiddlers Ferry for the next twelve months,” said Tony.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three year contract was originally agreed in April 2008 to work on the Coal Plant Operations and Maintenance sectors, with an option of a further two years. Costain is currently in the first quarter of extended option year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the reasons why the contract extension was granted was due to Costain’s excellent health and safety record and it’s versatile service delivery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain’s health and safety record has significantly improved during our tenure and the team has not experienced a lost time accident since 2006. This has resulted in a rolling 12 month Accident Frequency Rate (AFR) of zero, while the cumulative man-hours recorded without a lost time accident is now in excess of 1 million hours,” said Tony.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain would not have been considered for the contract extension unless it had shown continuous improvement in its health and safety performance, Tony said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“As part of their “Safety Family” initiative, SSE encourages everyone working at the site to actively participate in making Fiddlers Ferry a safer place to work. As a team, we have also adopted various initiatives as part of our SHE programme, which has enhanced the support of its major contract partners.  Our work and integration within this process has helped to generate an impressive safety record,” said Tony.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>20 August 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s major project to completely refurbish London’s Farringdon rail and Tube station has picked up another award.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain Laing O’Rourke joint venture (jv) won the Sustainable Excellence title at the Network Rail Partnership Awards for its work to bring the Grade II-listed mid-19th century station up to modern standards and prepare it for current and future expansion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among the sustainability aspects noted by the judges were:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• diversion of 100% of waste from landfill;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• high recycled content of steel and concrete;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• a 700m² ‘living roof’ on the new integrated booking hall to provide foraging grounds for black redstarts;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• and sensitive handling of heritage considerations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This partnership has really gone the extra mile to improve sustainability,” the judges commented.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of the waste was re-used on site, with the bulk of what was removed being shipped to a transfer station where 95% was recycled and the remaining 5% sent to a waste-to-energy power station, said Hannah Rich, Environmental Manager at Farringdon and who now holds a similar position at the London Bridge Station redevelopment project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some 8450 tonnes of demolition material was re-used on site, eliminating the need for 850 lorry movements and 30 tonnes of CO₂.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Soil removed from the site was distributed to various project sites around the capital, while 100% recycled steel was used in much of the permanent works. Brickwork arches were rebuilt to the original 19th-century pattern using reclaimed bricks that were hand-sorted to ensure an authentic appearance of the new brickwork.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wooden shop facades outside the station entrance were also restored.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The award was presented at London’s Park Plaza Hotel.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">15 August 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paul Sprague and Paul Higgins have become the first Costain people to complete the Further Learning Programme (FLP)*.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This achievement means that they both now have the required educational base for registration as a Chartered Engineer and makes them among the first in the industry to take a work-based learning route to Chartership.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The employer led programme was developed as an initiative to encourage Costain graduates to become Chartered. All of those involved in its development have continued their involvement as assessors or Supervising Engineers for the scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The programme was developed to allow candidates to achieve their learning outcomes through duties which were part of their daily responsibilities or through learning which was already part of Costain’s graduate development programme. This was supported further through mentoring by the scheme assessors. There are currently 15 people on the programme, which is fully accredited by the JBM (Joint Board of Moderators). </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paul Sprague, Senior Engineer on the A556 Knutsford to Bowdon Improvements, joined Costain in 2008 following a year’s industry placement during his BEng Civil Engineering degree at Bath University. He welcomed the opportunity to gain Chartered Status this way: “Gaining the required qualification without having to return to university was a big plus. I liked the fact that the FLP wasn’t purely academic: it allowed you to take what you were doing on a day-to-day basis and build on that.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paul Higgins, Civil Engineer on the Severn Trent Water AMP 5 Framework, joined Costain in 2009 after completing his BEng degree in Civil Engineering from Warwick University. “I did have other job offers but the chance to gain Chartered Status without having to do a masters degree definitely made the Costain offer more attractive,” he said. “The mentoring I received during the FLP was particularly useful – my mentors gave me excellent support.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rachel Ellison, Project Manager (Highways), and Hugh MacIntyre, Work Winning Director, are the Programme’s Supervising Engineers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rachel commented: “It’s a great first for Costain to have two graduates who have successfully completed the programme and can now go on for their Charterships with the Institution of Civil Engineers.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hugh agreed: “So many awards now are made on the competencies and capabilities of our staff, particularly in ECI (Early Contractor Involvement) contracts. Having Chartered Engineers ticks a lot of competency boxes.” </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For Bill Hewlett, Technical Director, the FLP is further proof of Costain’s commitment to education and learning. He said: “Costain has stepped up to this in a way that no one else in the industry has. We’re providing an industry-based route to Chartered Status that gives everyone with the competence and drive to become a Chartered Engineer that opportunity.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*Launched in 2009, the FLP provides an alternative route to Chartership by addressing the academic gap between a bachelors and masters degree. </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">15 August 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Welsh primary school children were given an early insight into the attractions of an engineering career when Costain supported the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) Bridge to Schools programme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Youngsters at Bryn Coch School, Mold, had the chance to create their very own bridge as part of a long-running campaign by the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB) and the ICE.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ICE owns several ‘build your own bridge’ kits, which are transported to schools around the country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The aim is to arouse interest in construction and engineering at an early age.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bridge exercise dovetails neatly with the Costain Cares strategy, which is about developing skills for the future, inspiring young people to think about a career in engineering and obtaining the necessary Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) skills to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bridge gives the pupils a chance for hands-on experience in building something. The sight of such a large structure turning up in the school is outside their daily experience and generates considerable excitement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Project Manager, Joe Rice-Jones, volunteers for a couple of days a year to help show pupils the ropes – or more accurately the nuts and bolts – when it comes to erecting the structure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The bridge is quite big, around 25 feet long,” said Joe. “It comes in the back of a large trailer and consists of a couple of metal A-frames, while most of the rest of the structure is wood.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pupils – who have been primed for the visit with fact packs explaining what the day will involve – are split up into groups handling different tasks in putting the bridge together, overseen by volunteers like Joe (an ICE member) and his colleagues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">None of the children are likely to have been involved in anything like putting together a large structure before. Being decked out in fluorescent safety kit and hard hats adds to the sense of occasion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s aimed at generating the idea that engineering is for everyone,” explained Joe. “We try to explain that not everyone can play football for Manchester United later in life and that engineering is an interesting and stimulating career.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We have many STEM ambassadors across the Group who volunteer their time to go into schools and inspire future budding engineers, as well as promoting other careers Costain has to offer,” said Corporate Responsibility Director, Catherine Warbrick. “As well as promoting the importance of STEM skills for business, we also want to attract the best young talent to Costain.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">13 August 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has won a contract to help keep rivers and waterways in the Midlands flowing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The framework contract for the Environment Agency – the first of its type for Costain – covers a wide variety of services, from routine inspections and maintenance of waterways to providing fast-response teams to handle incidents and minor asset repairs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Midlands Main Rivers Maintenance Framework will cover the Midlands Central and the Midlands West locations including the areas of Birmingham, Warwick, Shrewsbury, Kidderminster, Hereford and Pershore.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The contract fits nicely within the Costain Cares model,” said Anthony Watson, Water Sector Technical Director, who managed the successful bid and is responsible for the customer relationship.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain will be working collaboratively with the Environment Agency.” The framework contract calls for Costain to have a team at the site of a problem within 90 minutes of receiving an instruction to assist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Personnel will be on 24-hour standby, seven days a week, 365 days a year, and it is anticipated there will be at least one out-of-hours call per week – more at times of severe weather. A particular aspect of the contract is response to flooding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More regular activities will include the visual inspection of structures, defences and channels, with any debris or excess vegetation being cleared as required.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The four-year contract began this Summer.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>7 August 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain picked up a trio of titles at the 2013 Dwr Cymru Welsh Water Occupational Health &amp; Safety Awards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the glittering awards ceremony, held at the Liberty Stadium in Swansea, the Costain Welsh Water team won the ‘Most Improved’ performance category. It also took the Highly Commended slot in the Excellence Award, while Works Superintendent, Tony Kopec, was commended in the Outstanding Contribution category.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The team won the Most Improved award for its work on the Coed Dolwyd Service Reservoir scheme. The award was won not through recovering from a previous dip in performance but by a series of initiatives that led to continuous improvement on already high standards,” said Public Relations Manager for the Welsh Water AMP 5 framework, Sara Brady.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In its submission in the ‘Most Improved’ category the team noted that a safety, health and environment (SHE) training programme had been offered to all operatives to ensure the creation of a culture that encourages and looks closely at changing behaviours. There was a significant increase, for example, in the number of Safety observations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sara added: “The safety record on-site had been excellent, with more than 120,000 man-hours worked without a RIDDOR* up to 12 April. The team regularly scored above 8.5 in the monthly scored inspection (legal compliance being a score of 7.0) and numerous incentives had been developed to ensure that the team was continually improving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“All operatives were coached to be accountable and take responsibility for their own safety and that of their peers around them. The Gang Supervisors Coaching programme had been a positive initiative which had been devised to increase responsibility for Health and Safety amongst the workforce.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Highly Commended position was won for overall performance on the Framework, while Tony Kopec’s commendation was for rolling out the various SHE measures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ‘Most Improved’ and Excellence awards brought with them prizes of £1,000 and £500 respectively. This money will be donated to local charities, selected from suggestions by Costain Welsh Water staff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Framework Director, John Madden, commented: “Costain secured more awards than any other company and I would like to thank and acknowledge everyone’s efforts within the team for achieving these awards.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Matt Crabtree, Costain’s Sector Director for Water, added: “We have had some positive  feedback from Welsh Water recently regards our fantastic safety record and it is great to see the success of John and his team reflected at these awards”.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>6 August 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain graduates have rated Costain the best in the civil engineering and construction industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group came first in its sector in this year’s Top Companies for Graduates to Work For survey by The Job Crowd, the UK’s leading graduate job review website. The results are based on reviews submitted anonymously by graduate employees.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s great to know our graduates think so highly of us,” said Camilla Duncan, Graduate Development Officer, who collected the Job Crowd award with Rachel Phillips, Graduate Recruitment and Development Assistant, at a ceremony in June.  “The award also makes us more attractive to the new graduates we want to recruit. This year we will be recruiting around 60 – in previous years we’ve recruited around 45 – including some in disciplines new to us such as English and Business Management.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All the graduates spoke highly of Costain’s Graduate Development Scheme. They welcomed the amount of responsibility they were given early on, and liked how they were made to feel important to the business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We take time to listen to our graduates and use what they say to continually improve the programme,” said Camilla.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Their feedback told us that changes we’ve made to the Development Scheme, such as replacing modular training with graduate bootcamps to help promote unity amongst the cohorts, have gone down well. This is reflected in our rise in the rankings.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This year’s results and rankings won’t appear on The Job Crowd website until September but details of Costain’s performance in the 2012/2013 survey can be seen at:</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>5 August 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s commitment to safety has been illustrated once again by the team working on the Evaporator D project at Sellafield, which has achieved 1 million hours without a Lost Time Injury.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the second time over the life of the project that the 1 million hour milestone has been passed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The latest landmark represents an injury-free period from October 2011, which is particularly notable considering the risk profile of the work undertaken over that period.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The achievement – which would be significant on any project – has been reached against a backdrop of complex working conditions at the Evap D site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We have significant heavy lifting using gantry cranes, we’ve got welding, pipe-fitting, steel erection, civil engineering and electrical works, all within very close confines,” explained Project Director, Rob Phillips.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s a huge project but it’s happening in a building just 60 metres long by 30 metres wide at its widest point.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Combined with the limited space is the large number of personnel working on the job – around 400 people. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s attention paid to health and safety was further recognised by client Sellafield Ltd, whose Management &amp; Oversight of Contractors Department handed Costain the Most Improved Safety Performance award in May. This was in recognition of year-on-year improvements in safety performance since 2010 and the successful management of the multiple potentially high-risk activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“That has been down to continuous improvement,” explained Rob.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This achievement has required a major effort from the team, taking into account the working environment in which they’re operating,” added Costain’s SHE Director, Peter Fisher. “It’s a testament to the skill and effort they’ve put in to cope with a notably complex worksite.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">1 August 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, one of the UK's leading Tier One engineering solutions providers, is pleased to announce that it has today acquired EPC Offshore, a specialist oil &amp; gas project management services company, for an initial consideration of £9.6 million (plus £1.0 million for excess cash). Costain also announces the launch of Costain Upstream, which will provide services across the life-cycle of upstream offshore oil and gas assets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>EPC Offshore Acquisition</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Established in 2009, and with a workforce today of 75 professional staff led by founder and CEO Keith Wallace, EPC Offshore is a field development and project management specialist providing client-side services to North Sea oil and gas companies. The company is differentiated by its programme management expertise and the highly effective application of proprietary in-house systems and processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">EPC Offshore delivered revenue of £11.7 million, adjusted EBITDA of £2.0 million (adjustments reflect the removal of certain shareholder related costs that will not be incurred by the business in future) and profit after tax of £1.1 million for the year ended 31 July 2012. EPC Offshore had gross assets of £3.3 million as at 31 July 2012. The acquisition is expected to be earnings enhancing to Costain in the first full year of acquisition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The initial consideration for 100% of the share capital of EPC Offshore is £9.6 million (plus £1.0 million for excess cash included within the company) and was paid in cash on completion. Further consideration may also be payable depending on the financial performance of the business in the financial years ending 31 December 2014, 2015 and 2016 and the retention of certain key employees in 2016. This performance consideration is subject to a minimum of £2.0 million and a maximum of £14.4 million. The consideration funding will be provided from Costain’s existing debt facilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Launch of Costain Upstream</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Upstream will combine the capabilities of ClerkMaxwell, the oil and gas engineering and support services provider, which has more than doubled in size since its acquisition in 2011, and EPC Offshore to increase the scale of the Group’s services in the growing, high-value North Sea upstream oil and gas market. With a proven capability to deliver a wide range of services including engineering and consultancy, capital project management and asset support, the company will be strongly positioned in the UK offshore field development market where investment in 2013 is forecast at £13 billion (source: Oil &amp; Gas UK - Activity Survey 2013).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The newly formed Costain Upstream will deliver engineering, capital projects and asset support services across four principal service lines; Field Development, Subsea Facilities, Topside Facilities, and Floating Systems, and comprises a resource pool of over 350 people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Upstream will be led by Keith Wallace, Chief Executive of EPC Offshore, supported by the leadership teams of both ClerkMaxwell and EPC Offshore. They will be based in Aberdeen with operating and support units in Maidenhead, Teesside, Manchester and Abu Dhabi. The acquisition of EPC Offshore will significantly accelerate the growth and market position of Costain Upstream.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Andrew Wyllie, CEO of Costain, commented:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“We are delighted to welcome EPC Offshore to the Costain Group, in an acquisition which will accelerate our stated strategy of broadening our range of capabilities in response to the requirements of major blue chip customers.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“The formation of Costain Upstream will significantly enhance our position in this sector, and the acquisition of EPC Offshore will boost its growth, complementing the front-end engineering and operations capabilities we acquired with ClerkMaxwell two years ago.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“There is a sizeable addressable market for these highly complex services and we see further compelling opportunities to grow our oil and gas footprint both in the UK and internationally.”</strong></em></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>31 July 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, as part of the ABC Electrification Joint Venture with Alstom and Babcock, has started work on the collaborative delivery of Phase Three of Network Rail’s West Coast Power Supply Upgrade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The £48m contract will see the West Coast main line (WCML) between Whitmore, south of Crewe, and Great Strickland near the Scottish border, upgraded as part of Network Rail’s £100 million West Coast power supply programme. The works, which are part of Network Rail’s £9.4bn investment in electrifying the national railway network, will lead to more frequent services, longer, greener trains and an improvement in the commuting experience for passengers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a project of this size, which requires a diverse range of skills and experience, the team has adopted a collaborative approach to delivering the project in line with BS 11000, a British Standard that provides a framework for creating and managing collaborative business relationships. BS 11000 allows teams to apply best practice principles to their own methods of working while getting the most out of their working relationships.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Collaborative delivery is essential for the success of the project as the skills and disciplines required to complete it are very different, which presents a number of logistical challenges,” said Bob Halsey, the Project Director.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As well as the need to install power supplies and complicated overhead wiring, there is also a need for traditional civil engineering work such as substation development and other preparatory works. New troughing routes will be constructed and existing ones replaced where necessary, therefore being able to work in partnership is vital as it allows knowledge, skills and resources to be shared more effectively in order to meet mutual goals, said Bob.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Collaborative relationships also lead to better cost and risk management, as well as levels of innovation not normally achieved in a typical client-supplier relationship, thus enhancing competitiveness and performance. This approach is also in line with Costain’s Engineering Tomorrow strategy which aims to identify, develop and implement innovative solutions to meet the UK’s major national infrastructure needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mark Berg, acting Managing Director of ABC, believes the partnership is well balanced and offers the project a broad range of specialist expertise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Alstom provides a significant presence in the UK for power supply technology while Babcock brings extensive experience of maintaining and renewing railway-specific infrastructure, and Costain offers major project and programme management experience,” said Mark.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The integrated project teams are being jointly led by Network Rail and ABC, which means the project can be run with a joint management team of around 70 managers and supervisors. A project of a similar size a few years ago would have required up to 100 people and maybe more, said Mark.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For this project, which is due to be completed by the end of June 2016, ABC is mobilising its own operational depot at Crewe to work alongside the integrated design and programme management team based in the new ABC offices in Rugby. The project teams are also hoping to reduce the length of the contract by at least six months through a process of driving out inefficiencies and reducing any potential delays.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is the first time that a collaborative approach to project delivery has been undertaken by the central electrification team. It's all about the best way for the businesses to collaborate. The teams are already seeing the benefits of working in this way through integrated planning, cost forecasting and reporting,” said Katie Ferrier, Network Rail’s Programme Manager.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By working as one team, ABC is able to reduce design queries from around 40 days to, on occasion, resolving any queries on the same day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team is currently looking at possession strategies for the WCML route and reviewing possessions that are already planned for other work, such as track renewals, to see what work it can do at the same time, which is again where collaborative delivery can be used to ensure the future success of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are delighted to see the ABC Electrification come together in a project team that has been specifically designed to support Network Rail’s challenging electrification programme,” said Darren James, Costain’s Managing Director for Infrastructure.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">30 July 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Costain community specialist has played a key role in Canary Wharf College becoming one of the first two Free Schools in the country to be rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Martin Griffiths, Community Relations Manager on the Crossrail 360 Contract, is Chair of Governors at the primary school.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is the highest rating Ofsted can award. It’s a tremendous achievement for the Principal Sarah Counter and her team, and deserved recognition for all their hard work,” he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Education Secretary, Michael Gove, congratulated the school: “For a school to be rated outstanding within just two years is quite some feat – Canary Wharf College’s head, teachers and pupils should be proud of themselves.<br /> <br />“Free Schools, set up by dedicated groups of individuals and organisations, are raising standards and giving parents a real choice of good local schools. It is no wonder they are proving so popular with families.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Canary Wharf College opened on the Isle of Dogs in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in September 2011. Today it has 120 pupils from 46 nationalities who speak 26 different first languages.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Martin, who lives on the Island and whose six-year-old son is a pupil, has been a keen supporter of the school since its inception. He was asked to become Chair of Governors soon after his election as a parent governor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s a demanding role with a great deal of responsibility. But as Martin explained, it’s one where his experience with Costain stands him in good stead: “An important part of the Chair’s job is to engage with the local community. We want to show that the school is not only for local children but run by local people with the support of local residents and businesses.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The role enables Martin to make good use of the two paid days given to all Costain staff for volunteering. “This year I spent one day at a governor legal training course. On the other I led the inaugural Chair of Governors’ outing for the Year Three children. We walked across to Greenwich and visited the National Maritime Museum and the Cutty Sark - on the day Ofsted inspected the school!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So successful is Canary Wharf College that it now plans to open a second primary school in September 2014. It is also aiming to open a secondary school on the Island.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’ve got approval from the Department for Education and once premises are found funding will be given for the second primary school. If anyone knows of any empty buildings or vacant land in the Isle of Dogs area that might be suitable for a school, please do let me know,” said Martin.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, one of the UK’s leading engineering solutions providers, is pleased to announce that it has been awarded one of three places on the 132 kilovolt (‘kV’) and 33 kV Steel Tower Overhead Line framework contract with UK Power Networks.  The framework is initially valued at approximately £26 million over the next two years with the potential thereafter to extend the framework for a further eight years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">UK Power Networks is investing £360 million this year on upgrading the power distribution infrastructure in the South East, East of England and London and this framework contract forms part of that investment programme.  It involves the design and construction of 132kV and 33kV steel tower overhead lines and BT21 fibre-optics throughout UK Power Networks’ operational area, which covers more than 29,000 sq km from The Wash in the East to the River Arun on the South Coast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contract comes into effect immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive of Costain, commented,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“The upgrade of the UK’s electricity distribution system and the installation of fibre-optic infrastructure to improve connectivity are both major national needs. The appointment to this framework contract for a new customer demonstrates the success of Costain’s focus on blue chip customers who are investing billions in meeting these needs.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“It also reflects the success of our strategy to broaden our service offering to encompass design and advisory services as well as complex project delivery.” </strong></em></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">25 July 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The professionalism of a Costain joint venture (jv) in successfully delivering the M1 J10-13 improvement scheme has been marked with a cluster of awards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project, which was carried out on behalf of the Highways Agency, aimed to relieve congestion on the M1 motorway between junctions 10 and 13 by using gantry signs and signals to vary the speed limit and indicate when drivers could use the hard shoulder as an extra lane. This provided extra capacity at busy periods without the need to acquire additional land.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project was open to traffic more than four months ahead of schedule and is currently being handed over to the managing authority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the Institution of Civil Engineers’ (ICE) East of England annual awards the project took the Exceptional Merit Award for Physical Achievement. The Project was also awarded a Merit Award for Team Achievement at the ICE East Midlands award ceremony. The first of these, said the citation, ensured the project team “receive the acknowledgement and prestige they deserve, as the project’s achievements are a direct reflection of the great work that has been done by the whole M1 J10-13 team."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project was also the winner of an EasyWay Award. EasyWay is a pan-European project that aims to improve safety, mobility and environmental impact on the continent’s roads. The M1 J10-13 project won for having the greatest impact on EasyWay objectives for a large scale deployment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Further plaudits came from the Constructing Excellence in Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire Awards, where it won the Integration and Collaborative Working prize and was runner-up for the overall Project of the Year Award.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was also commended in the Major Project Category of the Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation National Awards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Topping off the prize bonanza was a photography award at the ICE East of England ceremony for a spectacular night-time image of the demolition of a bridge carrying the A5120 at Junction 12.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It was one of those projects that generally went very well from start to finish,” said Project Director, Bruce Richards. “It came in considerably under budget, more than four months ahead of schedule and had an excellent safety record, with an Accident Frequency Rate (AFR) of 0.065.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Highways Agency is pleased with our performance up there. Customer satisfaction scores are very high.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The awards are a reflection of the exceptional hard work put in by the whole site team delivering this under budget, early and safely.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">24 July 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of Costain’s next generation of tunnelling operatives took centre stage at the National Construction College (NCC) annual prizegiving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Three Year 1 tunnelling students - Shingai Musonza, Ben Brown and Jack Blackburn – were all nominated for the best student in their year at the NCC at Leytonstone, East London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The college opened three years ago; Costain sends some of its apprentices to a variety of training courses both there and at the Tunnelling Underground and Construction Academy at Ilford, a few miles away, which opened its doors in 2011 and on whose creation Costain  was consulted. The tunnelling course lasts for two years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apprentices at the two establishments undertake a combination of academic and practical work on either a day release or block release basis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Presenting the prizes at the NCC was Olympic silver medallist hurdler and television sports presenter Colin Jackson. He presented Costain’s three nominated tunnelling students with certificates, with one, Jack Blackburn, taking the prize as best Year 1 tunnelling student.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Watching the ceremony was Costain’s newly-appointed Apprenticeship Manager Caroline Towner: “It was a privilege to be part of the day,” she said. “It showed me the commitment Costain has for the Apprenticeship Programme within the business and the apprentices are clearly enjoying what they are doing.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are currently 61 apprentices throughout the Company and the intention is to improve on existing numbers.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">22 July 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is taking to the internet this week in the Company's quest for more innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A webinar on 23 July will encourage members of the Costain supply chain to come forward with new ideas, as well as steering them in the direction of funding they may require to nurture embryonic innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tuesday’s webinar will be jointly staged by Costain and the Environmental Sustainability Knowledge Transfer Network (ESKTN), a Government-funded body linked with the Technology Strategy Board.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ESKTN’s Jonathan Abra will give details on the different funding mechanisms available and where they are appropriate, for both Costain’s internal supply chain and others invited by the ESKTN. The presentation will be ‘badged’ under the Company’s Engineering Tomorrow initiative.   </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Engineering Tomorrow is the Company's commitment to identifying, developing and implementing innovative solutions to major national needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are increasing the drive towards finding innovative solutions for our customers and appreciate that our supply chain has a huge part to play in this,” said Graduate Civil Engineer, Mark Collier, from the Business Development Department, who organised the webinar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We recognise that this is a two-way relationship, where Costain should help provide our supply chain with opportunities to bring innovative solutions to market.  With this relationship we also recognise the need to increase the levels of communication with our supply chain partners.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“ESKTN will give ideas and help companies with a pointer in the right direction towards gaining funding to support innovative solutions. There are various forms of funding out there set up for different situations, but not everyone knows some of the smaller funding routes that are available.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tuesday’s event is intended to be the first in a series of webinars.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyone wanting to listen in to the webinar should be at a computer with internet connection at noon (12pm) on 23 July. Click on this link to join:</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">17 July 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The £68million Harbour Way section of the Peripheral Distributor Road in Port Talbot (a Costain project) has received national recognition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s achievement in handling the largest transport project to be supported by the European Regional Development Fund Convergence programme in Wales, with client Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council (NPTCBC) and key stakeholders, has been recognised by Constructing Excellence in Wales (CEW) with the Integration and Collaborative Working Award in the 2013 CEW Awards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CEW is a Welsh Government-backed organisation that helps the construction industry improve its performance in delivering better quality and value for money to clients and end users. It champions collaboration and best practices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Harbour Way provides 4.5km of dual carriageway access road from the M4 Junction 38, into Port Talbot and its docks.  It connects with previously completed stages. Costain is constructing it for NPTCBC.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The road has required particularly close collaboration with Indian steelmaker Tata, which owns the Port Talbot steelworks, as well as with Network Rail over whose tracks Costain had to build a major road bridge, and with local residents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Almost half the length of Harbour Way runs through redundant areas of the steelworks and Costain is creating new entries to the site. A Steering Management Team with the steelmakers was set up at the start of the project to minimise disruption during construction. More than 80 site services and utilities had to be diverted or protected to ensure steel production was unaffected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The net result, said Tata Steel’s Project Manager, Steve Jenkins, is that “Access and egress to our site will dramatically improve with the construction of the new roadways and will support our business for many years to come.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The road passes over the main Swansea to London railway. A 60-year-old bridge that had been the main entry into the steelworks and which passed over the railway had to be demolished, to enable a new, 150m road-over-rail bridge to be constructed as part of Harbour Way, requiring close co-operation with Network Rail during three rail possessions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is a great achievement for us, and testament to our ongoing efforts in working together as one team focused on the successful delivery of Harbour Way,” said Costain’s Project Manager, John Skentelbery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain also worked closely with representatives from Natural Resources Wales in the development and implementation of plans to remediate more than 9000m³ of contaminated material on-site, all of which was incorporated into the permanent works.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">16 July 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has won the Construction News Award for Best Use of Technology for the third year running.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This year’s winning entry is the Company’s innovative asset management tool MARIO (Mass Asset Recognition and Intelligent Optimisation). Developed in-house by a team led by Joe Rice-Jones, Project Manager, it gives clients a cost-effective and accurate picture of the condition of their infrastructure assets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s previous winners were its deployment of Primavera P6 in 2011 and its SwingletCAM in 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">MARIO uses a scanner attached to a vehicle to collect data. This data is then used to calculate assets’ location and condition. This reduces the manual process of collecting data and improves the accuracy of the information collected. To date 15 projects ranging from airports to motorways have been completed for both internal and external customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">MARIO particularly impressed the awards’ judges – 57 clients, consultants, contractors and representatives of government and industry bodies – with its quick and thorough surveying.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They commented: “The developed technology allows rapid and detailed surveying of infrastructure assets, is cheaper and safer than current alternatives, and allows direct links to the BIM (building information management) environment.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joe Rice-Jones collected the award at a ceremony at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London on 11 July attended by more than 1,000 of the industry’s finest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He commented: “This award validates my team’s breadth and depth of knowledge to deliver critical, estate-wide national infrastructure projects with our partners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joe added: “Winning this award three years in a row demonstrates Costain’s ambition to invent the future of business process automation for road and rail asset management.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">MARIO was the first winner of the Costain Start-Up initiative, an internal competition launched in 2012 to create and support innovative business ideas across the Company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alan Kay, Group Technical and Operations Director, commented: “This award is further proof that Costain provides an environment where innovation can flourish. It also shows our commitment to bring innovation to market faster to provide new services and solutions to our customers.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">15 July 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, as part of the 4Delivery team working with Southern Water on the Peacehaven Wastewater Treatment Works (WWTW), has achieved a major milestone in delivering cleaner seas for Sussex.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team has achieved compliance in the EU’s Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC) for the secondary treatment of wastewater for the Brighton &amp; Hove catchment, the final area of the UK to meet the EU water treatment directive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the size of the community in the catchment, the directive calls for the secondary treatment of wastewater before it is returned to the environment. The secondary treatment at Peacehaven involves biologically breaking down and reducing residual organic matter in the water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Achieving compliance means the wastewater produced by residents of Peacehaven, Telscombe, Saltdean, Rottingdean and Brighton and Hove is now being treated to this higher standard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The £300 million environmental improvement scheme will bring cleaner seas to Sussex and includes a major new wastewater treatment works, two underground pumping stations, 11 kilometres of new sewer tunnels and a 2.5km long sea outfall. Around 95 million litres of wastewater will be treated each day. The project is being overseen by 4Delivery, a consortium consisting of Veolia Water, Costain, and MWH.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are delighted to have achieved compliance for the wastewater treatment at Peacehaven, which is a major milestone in delivering cleaner seas to the Sussex coast,” said Contracts’ Manager, Graham Sugrue.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">11 July 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Three Cabinet Ministers today visited the new £32 million Walton Bridge, built by Costain, to celebrate the spectacular structure’s completion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Transport Secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, was joined by Defence Secretary, Philip Hammond and Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, at the first new road bridge to be built over the River Thames in more than 20 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To mark the occasion a flotilla of more than 60 boats passed under the 140-metre long crossing between Walton-on-Thames and Shepperton that took 18 months to build and will carry nearly 35,000 vehicles a day when it opens to the public on 22 July.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Transport Secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said: “This new bridge is an important link across the River Thames which will provide motorists, pedestrians and cyclists access to major employers, schools and retail centres.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bridge, which has been completed on time and on budget, replaces two long-serving temporary crossings next to it. The design means there are no piers in the water, opening up views along the river and improving navigation for boats.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contract for the new bridge was originally awarded by Surrey County Council in 2005 but the project has been the subject of two public inquiries and was put on hold during a government spending review. Costain started detailed design for the final time in 2011, with some advance works getting underway the same year and actual construction starting in January 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Darren James, Costain MD for Infrastucture, attended the ceremony along with other Costain people including Project Manager, Andy Bannister.   <br /> </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">9 July 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A joint team of Costain, MWH and Severn Trent Water staff has successfully completed work to ensure the resilience of a pumping station that ultimately supplies water to Severn Trent customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wyelands Pumping Station in Gloucester extracts raw water from the River Wye, which is then pumped to Mitcheldean Water Treatment Works (WTW). The WTW and the pumping station were constructed in the 1970s and pieces of critical infrastructure needed to be replaced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pumping station serves Mitcheldean and a failure there could have resulted in a loss of water supply to customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In spring 2012 work was carried out at Wyelands to replace a failed gasket on one of the valves. The valve was replaced with a spool piece.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was not possible to re-insert a new valve between existing flanges because the original installation did not include a dismantling joint. This meant that necessary maintenance work on the high lift pump delivery valves could not be carried out without a full drain down of the pipe main carrying water to Mitcheldean; an operation that could take around 15 hours and put domestic water supplies at risk.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team spent many months planning and preparing to install a new valve, dismantling joint and flexible couplings that would enable future removal of the valve and ease of maintenance, without risking loss of water to customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Installation began on 3 June, after all service reservoirs served by Mitcheldean had been filled to capacity. The pumping main was drained down early on 4 June to allow work to begin in earnest. The old pipe was removed and the new valve installed. By 6pm that day the team began recharging the water main using temporary pumps and full flow to Mitcheldean was restored early on 5 June.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the achievement, Severn Trent’s Service Delivery Manager, James Jesic, said: “The work over the last few days was the culmination of hard work, careful planning and preparation; the result was a fantastically developed and executed plan, which has helped to mitigate a significant company risk.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The dedication, commitment and team work shown by all members of the team from Costain MWH and partner contractors, Water Production, Distribution, COSC and Asset Creation has been exceptional.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">4 July 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain attended a construction industry seminar hosted by City law firm Pinsent Masons to show how improvements have been made in procuring and implementing major projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event brought together industry professionals who are likely to be leading the construction and infrastructure sectors in the future. Representatives included companies involved in procuring and delivering various combinations of design, finance, construction and maintenance of complex and critical infrastructure assets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event, called Construction Industry Leaders of Tomorrow, focused on how to achieve success in three critical areas: Contractual and Commercial Frameworks, Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Early Engagement of the Supply Chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oliver O’Brien, an Investment Analyst at Costain, attended on behalf of Costain, with Network Rail’s Daniel Lacey, a Procurement Manager on the Reading Station Area Redevelopment Programme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Citing a number of Network Rail projects as examples, Oliver and Daniel delivered a joint presentation using both the Thameslink programme (Farringdon Station and London Bridge Station) and the Reading Station Area Redevelopment Programme (Reading Station and Reading Viaduct) as case studies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oliver and Daniel explained how Costain and Network Rail, working as an integrated team, sought to achieve project success through collaborative learning. The lessons learned on one project were then carried forward to the next project in the programme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“As an industry it is important that we continue to develop how we procure and implement major projects. A significant part of this development lies in analysing and refining the critical success factors in project procurement and then carrying this learning onto future projects,” said Oliver.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has used these principles to become the first construction company in the UK to be awarded BS11000 Status, a British Standard for Collaborative Business Relationship Management Systems, for its work on the Reading Station Redevelopment programme. The Standard denotes that an organisation has demonstrated that it accurately assesses both itself and potential partners in terms of technical attributes and cultural fit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of Early Engagement of the Supply Chain, the lessons learned on the Reading Station Project within the Reading Area Redevelopment Programme, were then transferred to the next project, the Reading Viaduct. The lessons learned, from logistical challenges for example, helped Network Rail engage with its supply chain at the right stage and with the right people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oliver and Daniel then gave examples about how using innovative technology, like Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Augmented Reality (AR), has helped in the procurement and delivery of their projects.  Costain has used BIM, which allows engineers to generate and manage an enormous amount of data, on a number of major contracts, including Bond Street and London Bridge, and it is now seen as an invaluable component in the construction process.  AR, meanwhile, takes a real-world environment, such as a construction project, and augments it with computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data. Construction data from a project can be rendered onto a screen to build up an image of the finished project while also highlighting any potential problems or obstacles in the construction process. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oliver believes the key to achieving success in these three critical areas has come about through continuous learning and then trying to apply these lessons on different projects across the business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain’s culture of knowledge sharing and innovation has allowed us to achieve this. We are continuously trying to improve and innovate within our business and also in the way we deliver projects for our customers,” said Oliver.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>3 July 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Matt Ball has completed a 1,600 mile cycle trek from London to Gibraltar in 20 days in aid of Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Matt, a Development Director in the Water Sector, embarked on the so called ‘Fozball Rally’ on June 1st with fellow cyclists Mark Foskett (Foz) and Peter Baker, and supported along the way by Steve Cherry in a support vehicle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cycling team, which had a combined age of 160 years, rolled into Gibraltar on June 20th. The team embarked on the ‘Fozball Rally’ after their friend’s seven year old nephew was treated for leukaemia at the children’s hospital. To date the team has raised nearly £11,000 for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We wanted to do something that was going to be a challenge but also fun to do, and we wanted to do something for Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity because of the great work they do for children,” said Matt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After tackling London to Dover on day one, the team cycled from Dunkirk at the top of France down to Pau and then up to El Portalet, a mountain pass and old border outpost across the Pyrenees located 1,794 meters above sea level. The team then cycled down to Huesca in Spain before continuing south near Madrid, before skirting Malaga and then onto Gibraltar.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The guys averaged between 70 and 100 miles per day, spending around eight hours a day in the saddle, often in searing heat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To avoid the high temperatures during the day, the guys would get up at 6.30am for breakfast, check their bikes and have a team briefing by the captain for the day. The guys would then hit the road between 7 and 8am and cycle until they had reached their agreed stop at around 4 to 6pm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The climbing was really tough at times. I think the total climb as we cycled was the equivalent to four Everests, said Matt. “We tried to stay on the flat and avoid the climbing as much as we could, but in a lot of places it’s just impossible to avoid. But it was a fantastic experience and the support and generosity of the people we met on our journey was phenomenal. Whether we were cycling on the rural French roads or through Gibraltar’s bustling Main Street, people would stop and give us money for the cause and that really meant a lot to us.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on Matt and the team’s achievement, Sarah Canniford of Great Ormond Street Hospital, said: “Matt, Mark, Peter and Steve have completed an amazing challenge in support of Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity and we are so grateful for all their hard work and dedication. Every year the charity needs to raise at least £50 million to help give hope to very sick children and their families, and we would not be able to do this without the enthusiasm and commitment of our supporters. The phenomenal amount raised from the Fozball Rally will help us save more lives, develop new treatments, build state of the art facilities and support our patients and their families.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">2 July 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The acclaimed Peacehaven Wastewater Treatment Works (WTW), which provides wastewater services for the Brighton and Hove catchment, has picked up a further prestigious award.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The huge, grass-roofed treatment works and 11km of sewer tunnel through which wastewater travels to Peacehaven as part of the Cleaner Seas for Sussex project, constructed on behalf of Southern Water, won the Thomas Brassey Award from the Southeast England branch of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Branch members picked out the Peacehaven project as having demonstrated overall outstanding engineering excellence, said Contracts Manager, Graham Sugrue.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He and members of the consortium behind the £300 million project received the award at the SE England ICE branch award ceremony at Leeds Castle, Kent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain was part of the 4Delivery joint venture that included Veolia Water and MWH.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Peacehaven WTW is undergoing its final stage of commissioning before being formally tested and then handed over to Southern Water. Its introduction removes the final area in the UK required to meet the EU water treatment directive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vast quantities of earth have been moved to enable the treatment works to be hidden in a fold of the ground at Peacehaven and the grass roof further conceals he works presence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s quite fitting recognition for the real levels of engineering excellence I think we’ve had on this project,” said Graham – who also won the award in 2008 for an earlier project, a wastewater treatment works serving Margate and Broadstairs.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">1 July 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is in the process of implementing a series of Group wide initiatives aimed at strengthening its Apprentice Scheme and increasing its focus on technical training and the professionalism of its engineering community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The initiatives, which include recruiting more apprentices in a wider choice of disciplines as well as a sharper focus on training and leadership throughout the business and supply chain, are all in line with Engineering Tomorrow, the Company’s strategy to identify, develop and implement innovative solutions to meet the UK’s major national infrastructure needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of its aim to develop a workforce that is ready to meet the changing needs of its customers, the Company plans to launch a new Institute of Leadership &amp; Management (ILM) accredited Level 5 Leadership Programme, which will provide a solid foundation for the development of middle and senior managers across the business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“As an Approved Training Centre for the ILM, Costain already delivers, with the help of the National Construction College, the Level 3 Award to supervisory level, and these improvements will benefit not only individual employees, but will also be felt at the project, sector and national level as well,” said Jon Spencer, Costain’s Group Training Manager.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company also plans to implement an accelerated version of its Project Leadership Academy with 30 candidates studying for the Association of Project Management Professionals (APMP) examination from disciplines as varied as Finance and Training. Costain also expects to have 25 project management professionals targeting Registered Professional Status (RPP) with the Association of Project Management, to enhance continued professional development and to keep ahead of the demands of customers such as BAA, United Utilities and Network Rail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Investing in young people and helping the industry address the long-term skills shortage is an integral component of Engineering Tomorrow. For apprentices, there will be a renewed focus on new and existing apprenticeship frameworks and Costain’s internal Qualification and Credit Framework (NVQ) Centre will support the Company’s competence strategy across its contracts. These initiatives will be overseen respectively by Caroline Tower, the Company’s new Apprentice Manager, and Ivan Vukomanovic the NVQ Centre Manager.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now in its third year, the Costain Apprentice Scheme delivers excellent training and employment opportunities to young people seeking a career in the construction and engineering industry. The Scheme is linked to the Princes Trust and Construction Youth Trust, and now has over 60 apprentices working across the business, covering 11 disciplines like administration, accountancy, rail track and signalling, in addition to those traditional construction related opportunities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain also plans to recruit more students into a greater diversity of disciplines through its Sponsored Student Programme and Graduate Development Programme, including a new technical stream and the sponsorship of power graduates through the Power Academy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This year we have recruited in new graduates and disciplines such as Computer Science, Business Management and English. In addition, we are working to increase our capabilities in mechanical and electrical engineering and look forward to working as a partner company of the Power Academy,” said Camilla Duncan, Costain’s Graduate Development Officer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company’s supply chain will also benefit from these initiatives. Through the first round of the Government’s Employer Ownership of Skills initiative, Costain has been able to secure matched funding of half a million pounds which it plans to direct towards new apprentice frameworks, the further development of SMEs within its supply chain, and the improvement of its leadership and management skills.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Looking to Round 2 of the Employer Ownership of Skills initiative, a number of National Skills Academies have also embraced the initiative and if they are successful with their individual applications then Costain can look forward to working with them within its specific sectors of Rail, Nuclear and Power for the benefit of our employees and supply chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Although the detailed delivery has been demanding we’re really encouraged by the response in Round 1 and we look forward to developing it further in Round 2. This additional financial resource, linked by government to the employer rather than the training provider, has enabled Costain to increase the support of its supply chain beyond our traditional level of about 30% towards 50% during the early part of 2013. This achievement has direct benefit for our clients and the improved competency of our overall workforce,” said Jon Spencer.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>27 June 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, one of the UK's leading Tier One engineering solutions providers, today issues a pre-close trading update ahead of its interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2013, which will be announced on Thursday 22 August 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trading update</strong><br />In the first half of the year, Costain has been awarded new contracts and extensions worth more than £900 million to the Group, and is on-course to deliver a result for the year which is in-line with the Board’s expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group has continued to focus on ‘Engineering Tomorrow’: its commitment to delivering innovative, value-driven solutions to meet urgent and complex national requirements. Only a select group of companies in the UK meet the stringent criteria demanded by blue chip customers, who increasingly work only with suppliers who can deliver a full spectrum of services across the life cycle of a project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a consequence, the forward order book has increased from £2.4 billion as at 31 December 2012 to £2.9 billion. In addition, Costain continues to maintain a strong preferred bidder position of over £500 million. As at the end of the first half, over £850 million of revenue has been secured for 2013. Awards announced during the first half of the year include appointment to Thames Water’s AMP6 investment programme; the Hammersmith Flyover strengthening project as part of an Early Contractor Involvement framework for Transport for London; and a contract to design, fit-out and commission the railway systems for Crossrail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Lapse of proposed all-share merger with May Gurney Integrated Services plc </strong><br />On 30 May 2013 the Board of Costain confirmed that the proposed merger with May Gurney Integrated Services plc which was announced on 26 March 2013 had lapsed in accordance with its terms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Interim Results</strong><br />Costain will announce interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2013 on Thursday 22 August 2013.  There will be a presentation to analysts at 11am that morning at the offices of College Hill: The Registry, Royal Mint Court, London, EC3.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">24 June 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Southern Water’s ‘Cleaner Seas for Sussex’ project, constructed by 4Delivery joint venture (jv) comprising Veolia Water, Costain and MWH, has won another prestigious accolade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This £300 million project, which installed a state-of-the-art wastewater treatment works at Peacehaven to serve the Brighton and Hove catchment, picked up the ‘Large Firm Category’ for infrastructure projects in the annual Association of Consultancy and Engineering (ACE) awards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ACE has some 650 UK companies as members, many of them world class. The scope of work undertaken by ACE members can be seen from the other shortlisted projects, ranging from the strengthening of London’s Hammersmith Flyover to the creation of a Singaporean expressway and a Special Economic Zone in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Entries were judged on overall engineering excellence, taking into account factors such as innovation, originality and complexity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Peacehaven project was entered for the ACE award by jv partners MWH. The plant is currently handling wastewater and is in the final stage of its commissioning phase, prior to being formally handed over to the client, Southern Water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The award was handed over at a ceremony at London’s Victoria Park Plaza Hotel by BBC newscaster, Huw Edwards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is further recognition of what has been a truly outstanding project,” said Costain’s Water Sector Director, Matt Crabtree. “The team behind Peacehaven can take great pride in what they’ve done.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">20 June 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is helping organise a major event in the northwest this weekend, designed to interest local school children in subjects vital for the future of the UK economy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a prelude to the Whitehaven Festival, one of the biggest family events in the UK that attracts up to 300,000 visitors to the small town of Whitehaven, Costain originated the idea for a STEM Day – Science Technology Engineering and Maths – for local school pupils.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Whitehaven Festival is the biggest event in the county,” said Costain’s Community Relations Officer for West Cumbria, Luke Richardson “and we got the idea to launch our event on the back of this.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He initially thought of having a project manager undertake the presentation, but realised that most Costain site-based personnel have limited experience of addressing 800 boisterous schoolchildren.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With that in mind, popular television science presenter Steve Mould will be hosting the STEM Day, giving presentations to encourage them to get involved in STEM subjects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Something of a ‘STEM celebrity’, Mould’s freewheeling approach to the subject matter is designed to make it more engaging for pupils. Mould is a science presenter for the BBC on Britain's Brightest and The One Show, and a former Blue Peter presenter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Most people think of science as exemplified by a guy in a white lab coat and glasses,” said Luke Richardson, who came up with the idea for the day. “We want to get away from that image.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We want to ensure that when the kids go away, they have learned something.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has sponsored the Festival for five years, but Luke Richardson – a former volunteer organiser of the event – wanted to do something more. “We were looking at sponsoring it again but we were very keen to do something educational as well.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">19 June 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work has started on enlarging a roundabout on Junction 21 of the M5 at Weston-Super-Mare. The £4 million contract, jointly funded by the Department of Transport and North Somerset Council, promises to bring substantial improvements to the area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is the first that Costain has won under an asset support framework contract, one of five traffic improvement projects known as the Weston Package being managed by the council.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The junction handles a large north-south through-flow of traffic on the M5. It also handles a cross-flow from Weston-super-Mare to Bristol along the A370 and gives access to a large Lidl supermarket distribution centre nearby.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently a two-lane roundabout, Costain will be adding a third lane, with the works including a dedicated filter lane from Weston-super-Mare on to the M5. Costain will also install traffic-responsive traffic signals. The net effect will be to move vehicles through the roundabout much more quickly than at present.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s a very sensitive roundabout,” said Costain’s Project Manager, Dave Forbes. Although it came under particular strain in summer with tourist traffic, it was always busy and a major challenge for the project team was to keep traffic flowing throughout the duration of the contract.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“From an engineering point of view the work poses a number of challenges, but perhaps the greatest is organising a safe programme of work in close proximity to the M5 and minimising disruption to road users and local businesses.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The work impinges on the nearby community of St Georges. Residents are being kept closely informed of the progress of the works, with a project helpline set up to cope with any challenges they encounter as well as providing motorists with a link to project information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work is due to be completed around the turn of the year.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">18 June 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is looking for experienced people to fill senior consultancy roles in the Persian Gulf as it further strengthens its project and programme management consultancy offering in the region.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tim Bowen, Costain’s Regional Development Director, moved to the Middle East late last year with the task of expanding the Company’s range of services in the Gulf States, and he has found there is no shortage of potential work for a company like Costain which specialises in engineering, project management and operation of key national assets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2013 alone, infrastructure and development projects worth over $350 billion are planned across the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a political and economic union of Arab states that includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. More crucially, the work will require consultancy services, whether in providing engineering solutions or delivering integrated consulting and operations and maintenance services, which is where Costain hopes to make a difference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’re not looking for construction contracts, even though there has been no shortage of opportunity in that regard. I’m here in the Gulf to develop the Costain advisory proposition and present our considerable expertise, systems, processes and people to clients here. We have been in Abu Dhabi for 50 years and we’ve got a fantastic reputation here,” said Tim.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Costain has the scale, skills, experience and financial strength necessary to secure and then deliver these large and complex projects, but at this time, the price point competition from some Asian contractors mean that there’s no point wasting our valuable bidding resources when there are many commercially preferable opportunities in professional services,” he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tim added: “We’re looking to work more on a consultancy basis, either on our own or as part of a joint venture with another company. But our biggest constraint is the availability of professionally qualified, experienced people, i.e. those at the most senior level, because these projects are vast and will include working at the cutting edge of engineering technology.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Places like Qatar present enormous opportunities. The state is hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup and plans to put in place vital infrastructure in order to meet its ambitious growth plans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Contracts are now starting to be awarded as Qatar plans to invest $200 billion in infrastructure development over the next 10 years, with over $100 billion expected to come in the next five years as it gears up for the World Cup. The projects include new roads, highways, bridges, airport, a new seaport, and a new rail and metro system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This investment is part of a broader vision to meet the state’s growth and infrastructure needs beyond the FIFA World Cup.  The president’s executive office of the Public Works Authority (Ashghal) recently announced that more than $30bn would be allocated for the implementation of over 700 projects to meet the objectives of Qatar National Vision 2030.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s ambition in the region is in line with 'Choosing Costain,' the Company's strategy to deliver a full-service offering, from front-end engineering consultancy and design, through construction to back-end care and maintenance. In the Middle East, the emphasis will be on offering a consultancy service, which is why experienced specialists are required to fill the senior roles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain has a rich history of engineering excellence but we need to reconsider our market positioning and the manner in which we fulfil those opportunities. Part of the solution is for us to go to the market, recruit and bring capacity into the business. Therefore, in line with our best in class approach, we are looking for senior level sector experts to join me to grow our new business in the region,” said Tim.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">17 June 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has successfully renewed its certification as an organisation that strives to accurately report on and reduce its carbon emissions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following its 2012 certification to the Certified Emissions Measurement And Reduction Scheme (CEMARS), it has again achieved the standard, demonstrating that Costain has accurately measured its greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with ISO 14064-1:2006 and is committed to managing and reducing those emissions. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company had to demonstrate to the certification body that it was undertaking actions that were effectively reducing emissions, said Carbon Co-ordinator, Claire Baker.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Actions undertaken over the year to reduce carbon emissions have included:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• an Energy Awareness Week last November that led to average reductions of 2-5% in electricity usage across the business;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• installation of energy-efficient LED lighting and other energy saving technologies at various locations. In head office, at Maidenhead, the retrofitted LEDs will provide savings of approximately £3000 and 17 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent per year;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• continued implementation of green transport plans on all sites to promote sustainable transport options;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• promotion of conference-calling and the 5p per mile car-sharing incentive which has led to a 51% rise in conference call minutes and a reduction in mileage claimed throughout the year;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• promotion of low-carbon measures throughout the supply chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main challenges with this year’s re-certification was the inclusion of the 2011 acquisitions into the Group ‘carbon footprint’. Collecting the extensive carbon data necessary required input from numerous parties across the business. This was successful and the acquisitions have now been fully integrated into the Costain Carbon Reporting Processes. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company is also working on a climate change strategy, due to be introduced later this year, which will guide the way the Company will reduce its own emissions as well as those of our customers through providing innovative solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overall, Costain is continuing to work towards its pledge to reduce carbon emissions by 55% by 2020, over a 2009 baseline measurement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The calculations for 2012 that have been recertified by CEMARS exclude joint ventures or work undertaken outside the UK. During 2013 the Company will strive to expand the footprint to include these.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">14 June 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has further underlined its commitment to safety, with the GCA joint venture (jv) delivering United Utilities’ (UU) AMP 5 Framework passing 3 million hours without a lost-time incident.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GCA comprises Galliford Try, Costain and Atkins. The jv, whose Costain members come from the Natural Resources Division, undertakes maintenance, repair and upgrade projects on a swathe of UU sites across northwest England.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GCA Framework Director, Mick Ogden, put the jv’s industry-leading performance down to a combination of strong leadership, coupled with rigorously enforced, robust procedures and backed up with a behavioural-based programme of training and engagement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">UU senior management added its support for the jv’s efforts to ensure safe working.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is an absolutely fantastic achievement and one that you should all be rightly proud of,” commented Engineering &amp; Capital Delivery Director, Neil Colman. “This consistent level of performance does not come without robust work processes, good systems, focused leadership and that constant desire to challenge and improve.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Colleague Damien Hackett, General Manager for the UU Process Alliance, added: “It goes without saying that this is an outstanding achievement. It proves if we get the culture correct we can deliver safe projects, send everyone home safe at the end of the shift and deliver on the belief that nothing we do is worth getting hurt for. A huge ‘Well done’.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their comments were echoed by Costain Safety, Health &amp; Environment Director, Peter Fisher: “It’s very gratifying to see all the effort we put in on instilling good health and safety practices paying off. Everyone at Costain knows that it takes a combination of the right behaviours, constant vigilance and attention to detail every day to get a result like this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s an outstanding effort and one that we want to emulate and extend throughout the Company’s sites.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Carl Mason recently helped to save the life of an elderly man after he collapsed outside Costain Skanska JV’s Crossrail worksite at Bond Street, in central London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Carl, a General Foreman on the site, responded to a radio call for assistance and arrived to find the man on Davies Street unable to breathe. Despite a number of people trying to assist the man, no one knew what to do until Carl arrived to put the man in the recovery position and free his airway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Carl administered first aid for at least 10 minutes, clearing the man’s airway with a radio aerial while following instructions from paramedics by phone until the ambulance arrived.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“He was turning blue and he would have died without having his airways cleared. The man’s tongue kept collapsing and blocking his airways, but I used a radio aerial to keep his tongue free for him to breathe. Being a trained first aider, it has become second nature to administer first aid when needed,” said Carl.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">11 June 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Tracey Wood has completed her first triathlon, fulfilling a long-held personal ambition and developing a taste for gruelling endurance events in the process. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tracey, Costain’s Company Secretary and Legal Director, successfully completed the Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research Blenheim Palace Triathlon Sprint on June 8, finishing it in 2 hours and 12 minutes, which included the transition time it takes to travel between each discipline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Blenheim Palace Triathlon Sprint comprises a 750 metre swim across an open lake, a 19.8 kilometre bike ride and a 5.4km run. With a beautiful view at every turn, Blenheim Palace near Oxford is surrounded by 2,000 acres of landscaped parkland.  As the birthplace of Winston Churchill its reputation as a tourist attraction is second to none, but it’s also the second biggest triathlon event in the UK, after the London Triathlon, and attracts around 5,000 competitors each year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s a beautiful setting but you’re completely focused on finishing the event. I trained in open water at Bray Lake in Maidenhead but no matter how much training you do, no matter how many times you go in, nothing really prepares you for swimming in open water. It’s freezing, you’re freezing, the wet suit weighs you down and the local wildlife always seems to find a way to hamper your progress. It’s quite an experience,” said Tracey.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tracey decided to enter the triathlon as a way to get fit after giving birth to a baby girl in September 2012. She trained for around 10 weeks prior to the event, swimming twice weekly at Bray and running and cycling at least twice a week to build up her stamina, but there were challenges.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Working full time, finding the time to train and being a new mum was challenging but I think you need to have a goal. I’ve run three marathons but they can be quite repetitive and I’ve always wanted to do a triathlon. Technically, you have to get everything right in all three disciplines,” said Tracey.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having caught the triathlon bug, Tracey now plans to enter the Human Race Triathlon at Dorney Lake near Windsor, the scene of GB’s Olympic rowing triumphs in London 2012, this September.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, Tracey’s ultimate ambition is to compete in the Comrade’s Marathon, a lung busting ultra-marathon measuring 56 miles (89 kilometres) which is run annually between Durban and Pietermaritzburg in Kwazulu-Natal Province, South Africa.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“That’s my ultimate goal. I want to have completed the Comrades race by the time I’m 60, but you have to have a marathon time of less than five hours before you can even enter. I need to do a lot more training to get there but it’ll be fun,” said Tracey.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">6 June 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain had a chance to show Welsh policymakers the scope of its involvement in the Principality as it took part in an exhibition at the Welsh Assembly Senedd building in Cardiff. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event was organised by the Welsh arm of the charity Business In The Community (BITC)*.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following such practices requires BITC members to honour ethical values and respect the local communities and the environment in which they work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’ve supported BITC Wales for five or six years,” said Senior Community Relations Officer, Brian Greaves, who handles a cluster of projects in the Principality and the West Country.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BITC works with around 140 companies in Wales with 20 showcasing their activities to Welsh Assembly Members (AMs) at the Senedd event.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has had an ongoing presence in Wales – particularly in creating roads in South Wales – for many years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We went along with corporate banners and lots of examples of how we’ve been displaying responsible business policies over the years – for example, through education, providing local employment and engaging with local youth,” said Brian.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“During the event, Edwina Hart, Minister for Economy, Science and Transport in Wales, came and had a chat about what we were doing. We have a number of projects in South Wales – for example Harbour Way, Port Talbot and the A465 Heads of the Valleys dualling project between Gilwern and Brynmawr – that really do beneficially affect road infrastructure in the area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It was generally a chance for AMs to see what we’re doing in Wales and for us as a member of Business in the Community to reaffirm our position as a responsible business.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*The Costain Group is a major national player in the BITC scheme, which encourages commercial organisations to engage with local communities and pursue responsible business practices.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">5 June 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain Skanska joint venture (CSJV) team working on the new Bond Street station for Crossrail has been awarded “Inspirational” status in Crossrail’s Gateway Health and Safety scheme, a first for a contractor working on the new £15billion rail link.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gateway is a bespoke health and safety scheme Crossrail brought in a year ago under its Target Zero – A State of Mind initiative, which aims to deliver a world class health and safety standard across the entire programme, protecting the work environment and keeping everyone safe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gateway measures and celebrates the health and safety performance of its contractors. Each company is marked under six major pillars which include Leadership and Behaviour; Communication; Designing for Health and Safety; Workplace Health; Workplace Safety and Performance Improvement. Assessed every four months, a total of 21 contractors were appraised in the most recent round, so to be the first team to attain “Inspirational” status is a major achievement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are delighted to have achieved success in the latest round of Crossrail’s Gateway Scheme. It came as a result of a team effort at Bond Street where everyone has a voice and everyone is empowered to ensure safety is number one. We have a project environment where seeking alternative, safer and innovative ways of working is actively encouraged,” said Claire Carr, the Costain Project Manager at Bond Street.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the team’s performance, Hamza Shuaib, the Health and Safety specialist who led the Gateway assessments on behalf of Crossrail, said: “The CSJV team at Bond Street has consistently excelled at communicating health and safety.  Their ability to continually devise innovative ways to improve and raise the bar in all six Target Zero pillars over the past three cycles of Gateway demonstrates their commitment to ensuring that all on the project go home unharmed every day.  The team at Bond Street is inspirational and truly deserves this accolade.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fundamental principles of the Gateway Scheme, which aims to empower people to make the right decisions, is similar to Costain’s own highly successful health and safety programme, Costain Behavioural Safety (CBS), which is now being applied in a wider behavioural management and leadership programme across all aspects of its business.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>4 June 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has secured funding from the Government linked *Technology Strategy Board’s £18million competition to develop the civil nuclear supply chain. Costain has been selected to develop three innovative technologies to reduce the cost of treating and storing nuclear waste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This competition brings together experienced organisations (such as Costain) with small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and universities to develop the supply chain and encourage innovation. It was co-funded by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain will work with a range of UK organisations to deliver these technologies. In collaboration with Tetronics International, Costain will develop a plasma waste vitrification system which will reduce the volume, and significantly enhance the stability, of intermediate level waste (ILW).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a further project being led by Bradtec and supported by Studsvik, Hyder Consulting and the University of Manchester, Costain is developing a system for the gasification of graphite from decommissioned nuclear reactors. This will significantly reduce the volume of graphite waste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is also working with Createc to trial on site a system to measure the depth of contamination in structures. This will enable decontamination measures to be targeted more accurately and reduce the volume of material to be treated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In making the announcement, the Government’s Business Secretary Vince Cable, said: “There are huge global opportunities that the UK is well placed to take advantage of in the nuclear industry. Our strong research base will help develop exciting new technologies that can be commercialised here and then exported across the globe.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>3 June 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, one of the UK’s leading Tier One engineering solutions providers, is pleased to announce that it has been awarded one of four places on Transport for London’s (‘TfL’) framework for Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) and Construction, initially worth approximately £200m overall. The Group is working on its first project within this framework: the Hammersmith Flyover strengthening project, worth approximately £60m.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The full project scope will be defined during the ECI phase, but is likely to involve strengthening the flyover using post-tensioning, replacing bearings, waterproofing and resurfacing the deck, and replacing the drainage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hammersmith Flyover, which is used by 90,000 road users a day, is situated on one of London’s main strategic routes, and the strengthening work is essential to keep London moving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The framework and the ECI work for Hammersmith start immediately; the framework will run for four years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive of Costain, commented:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“Costain is delighted to gain a place on TfL’s framework, and to commence work on the Hammersmith Flyover which is a technically challenging structure and an important part of London’s infrastructure.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“This award further enhances Costain’s reputation for innovation and engineering expertise across the whole life cycle of an infrastructure asset, as well as our recognised commitment to providing our customers with certainty of delivery and cost within a collaborative working approach.”</strong></em></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">30 May 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new £9million service reservoir at Coed Dolwyd, near Glan Conwy, north Wales, has become a major local attraction since work began on the Welsh Water scheme in July 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain project, to construct an innovative below ground clean water service reservoir,  is progressing well and reached the half way milestone in March.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project has already welcomed numerous visitors to the site which has included MP for Aberconwy, Guto Bebb and Welsh Assembly Member for Aberconwy, Janet Finch Saunders.  Conwy County and Community councillors and local college students have also paid a visit to the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking of her visit, Mrs Finch Saunders said: “I am delighted to have witnessed first hand this marvellous feat of engineering in the early stages. This reservoir, once complete, will ensure that Welsh Water will continue providing a first class water storage facility for our residents in Aberconwy.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The media has also been keen to cover the progress being made on the major engineering project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In March, the BBC Wales TV and Radio came to site to see the work that was being undertaken on behalf of Welsh Water. Costain Construction Manager, John Salisbury was interviewed about the project which was later aired on the BBC news programmes on both TV and radio.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the BBC, the main daily newspaper for North Wales, Daily Post, also reported regularly on the reservoir, its benefits and progress to date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Madden, Costain Framework Director, said: “We have been pleased to welcome so many visitors to this exciting scheme at Coed Dolwyd. We are anticipating the project being operational by December 2013, and I hope that the local and national interest in the reservoir continues to the end of the project. The whole framework is proud of the efforts being realised at Coed Dolwyd.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team on site also has an impressive safety record having worked more than 100,000 man hours without a reportable accident.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">30 May 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A school built by Costain to meet the demands of the 21st Century was recently named Best Education Building at the annual LABC London Building Excellence Awards 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deptford Green School in Lewisham, east London, was named Best Education Building at a ceremony held at London’s Guildhall. The awards celebrate the very best in construction from across the London region, with winning projects recognised for their high level of skill, professionalism and team work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deptford Green’s new school buildings brought all the students together onto a single site and were designed to be accessible for disabled people and include various sustainable technologies. It opened in September 2012 offering state of the art learning opportunities, wireless technology, biometric cashless payment and registration systems, music classrooms, a sound recording studio and radio station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The judges noted that a close working relationship between Lewisham Council’s building control team meant that most of the green targets were exceeded and the new building achieved a BREEAM excellent rating.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the school, LABC Chief Executive Paul Everall, said: “This remarkable new school building shows the benefit of close working relationships between building control and contractors.  As well as providing a sound learning environment the buildings are energy efficient and provide natural ventilation and light, exceeding the sustainability targets set out at the start of the project.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">LABC is the member organisation representing Local Authority Building Control departments in England and Wales. It membership includes over 3,000 professional surveyors and support technicians across 12 regions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deptford Green School is one of nine constructed by Costain in Lewisham and was built as part of the Lewisham BSF Framework in partnership with Watkins Gray International Architects and Ramboll Structural Engineers. Costain received a similar award for Sedgehill School in 2010 and Trinity School in 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the award, Clive Kraus, the Senior Project Manager, said: “We are delighted to have been recognised at the LABC London Region Building Excellence Awards. This award is testament to all the hard work from everyone on the team to produce a world class educational establishment.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">28 May 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is helping to organise an event in Whitehaven that aims to spark an interest in science, technology, engineering and maths for school children in the West Cumbria area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event is being held at Whitehaven Harbour on Friday June 21 and is being organised by Costain, National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) and Sellafield Ltd. Over 720 school children are expected to visit the Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) event, which is taking place just before the annual Whitehaven Festival and with the support of the Whitehaven Festival Company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Local schools have been invited to take part in the STEM Festival which includes a talk and demonstration hosted by Costain in the 200-seat education theatre, wacky science demonstrations by NNL, an array of fun activities organised by Sellafield and a visit around the tall ships and Navy vessels. Steve Mould, a comedian and television science presenter, will be there with a stage show that covers physics, chemistry and psychology all wrapped up in dramatic experiments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The promotion of STEM will continue over the weekend (Saturday 22 and Sunday 23 June), allowing Festival-goers to watch the creation of oddly shaped bubbles, wonder at the many 'cool' uses of nitrogen and be amazed at a show full of flashes and bangs, all inside the Samuel Lindow Foundation tent on Whitehaven Harbour.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Members of The Royal Society of Chemistry, the Institute of Physics and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers will join fellow STEM enthusiasts from Costain, Atkins, NMP and Sellafield Ltd, as well as from the National Nuclear Laboratory, guiding a constant stream of small hands and inquisitive minds through experiments to show how much fun science is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Luke Richardson, Community Relations Manager for Costain, said: “The aim of the Whitehaven STEM is to promote careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths.  These subjects are really important for the development of Britain's Energy Coast Master plan. I’m really pleased that Costain has sponsored the appearance of Steve Mould as special guest. We also have a lot of staff who will be supporting the event through our Costain Volunteering policy which is great news. The event will be proof of what can be done when companies come together and share resources.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rory O’Neil, Director of Stakeholder Relations for Sellafield, added: “The Whitehaven Festival is a fantastic event and we are delighted to be getting our STEM ambassadors involved in it. Sellafield Ltd will be working in partnership with NNL and Costain to support the Whitehaven STEM Festival by inviting students along to their STEM Marquee. The Marquee will be packed with all manner of challenging hands-on activities for all ages. Our STEM ambassadors will assist students as well as providing support in the NNL tent with the delivery of their science shows.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">23 May 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain personnel have won three of the four annual prizes from the Civil Engineering Contractors Association (CECA) in Wales to reward promising trainee engineers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three young engineers – Christopher John, Richard Scammel and Mark Ruiz – were recognised for their skills at the CECA annual dinner at Cardiff’s Marriott Hotel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Christopher, currently working on the All-Wales Communications Maintenance project at Treforest, was outright winner of the competition. Richard, a member of the A465 Heads of the Valleys road widening project, was runner-up, while Mark, who is helping handle the Harbour Way road project in Port Talbot, took the special prize.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The awards were handed over by Jeff Cuthbert AM, the Welsh Assembly’s Deputy Minister for Skills and Technology. They aim to recognise significant potential and professional development in the construction industry and identify the most promising trainee engineers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CECA Wales director, Rhodri Gwyn Jones, commented: “Continuing the training of new entrants into the civil engineering industry is crucial if it is to survive and prosper into the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We sought evidence of [entrants’] development and potential, their capacity and hunger, and we found that in abundance in the award winners.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The achievement of the Company in taking all but one of the awards was remarked upon by Bruce Richards, Project Director of the Heads of the Valleys contract: “The quality of the engineering team at Costain is critical to the delivery of high-profile and technically-challenging infrastructure projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s extremely pleasing to see that three of our trainee engineers are excelling in their development and striving to achieve the highest standards in their work.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">22 May 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has featured strongly in this year’s Considerate Constructors Scheme (CCS).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company took the two runners-up awards for the national champion: the C405 London Paddington Station project, in joint venture (jv) with Skanska, and the M53 Bidston Moss viaduct strengthening project on The Wirral.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It also won three further Gold Awards, five Silver and ten Bronze, in a demonstration of the efforts that the Company’s workforce go to, in order to minimise disruption to residents around its sites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The CCS is the national initiative set up by the construction industry to improve its image. Construction sites and companies that register with the scheme are monitored against a Code of Considerate Practice, designed to encourage best practice beyond statutory requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The full roll of honour for Costain in this year’s contest was:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gold: C405 London Paddington underground station; Bidston Moss Viaduct; Bond Street Tube station upgrade (in jv with Laing O’Rourke); London Power Tunnels; and A8 dualling Belfast to Larne (as part of Lagan Ferrovial Costain consortium).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Silver: Cleaner Seas for Sussex Scheme - 4Delivery Ltd; Overton WTW - 4Delivery Ltd; M62 J9-11 improvements - A One+; Severn Trent Water – Coundon, distribution service reservoir; and Pontypridd town centre regeneration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bronze: Brookfield Place &amp; The Paddock - 4Delivery Ltd; Charing WTW - 4Delivery Ltd; Oxted WTW - 4Delivery Ltd; M1 J10-13 improvements scheme (in jv with Carillion); Thameslink – Farringdon Station (in jv with Laing O’Rourke); Newbury Parkway; Port Talbot PDR Phase 2; A244 Walton-on-Thames Bridge replacement; Prendergast Hilly Fields school; and Prendergast Vale school.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Martin Quaid, Project Director at Paddington underground station, commented: “We are committed to working with the communities around our worksites to minimise the impact from our construction works and to provide the best conditions for the workforce. This is really important to us as a business and also to our client, Crossrail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are going to continue to work closely with the Paddington community as we progress the construction of the new Paddington Crossrail station.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The CCS citation for the project said: “This major infrastructure project required a new underground interchange hub for Crossrail next to London's Paddington station, with significant excavation, diaphragm walling, and a short tunnel to connect with the existing underground lines. This remains a high profile project, and was particularly so during the Olympic Games when the station was widely used by visitors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Thanks to excellent displays, highly- effective noise suppression, courteous staff and attention to detail, the impression delivered to travellers evidenced the ability to carry out an ongoing transformation in a modern capital city without disrupting its inhabitants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Acoustic tents helped avoid disturbance to neighbouring offices, while careful monitoring was achieved through 1,200 measurement points. Staff and operatives engaged extensively with local business activities and enjoyed an excellent level of dialogue. Specially constructed welfare areas were provided for drivers while they awaited their delivery slots and for non-project train drivers to rest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“There was also strong engagement with the wider community including careers advice to youngsters and paid internship opportunities. Staff also joined the local school governors on the board, and there were numerous examples of direct support for both individuals and charities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Despite the heavy and extensive works in progress, this site maintained an immaculate presentation in all areas, and remains a key player in promoting both the Scheme and the construction industry.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project was this month also awarded a RoSPA gold award for the second year running for its exemplary efforts in health &amp; safety.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">21 May 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain team working on the new Walton Bridge Crossing has helped to raise £3,200 for the Sunbury and Walton Sea Cadets after the team delivered the Rotary Club of Shepperton Aurora’s Annual Prestige Lecture in Shepperton, south west London, recently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event took place at Halliford School and was titled “From Canaletto to Costain” – after Canaletto’s depiction of the first bridge which he painted in 1754. The team, which included Community Relations Manager, Luke Richardson, and Project Manager, Andy Bannister, gave the 320-strong audience an evening of local history, poetry and an insight into how bridges are constructed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nick Pollard, the President of the Sunbury and Walton local historical society, opened the lecture with a historic review of the five bridges that have previously occupied the site. The factual parts of the lecture were interspersed with poetry written especially for the evening and recited by Joseph Butler, a published poet and blacksmith who lives and works in Oxford.  His four poems captured the social and historical importance of the bridge to the local community. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All proceeds from the evening went to the sea cadets based at TS Black Swan on Penny Lane, Shepperton, after they were named as the Rotary Club’s chosen charity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The money raised from the event will go towards building modular jetties that allow boats to get on and off the water a lot quicker, as well as improving the toilet and shower facilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gail Cramp, Chairman of the Sunbury and Walton Sea Cadets, said: “Costain’s support has meant an enormous amount to us. To have a team of people working together on our behalf is enormously uplifting and we have been totally overwhelmed by the kindness and support. We try hard to turn out young people with life advantages and community spirit that they would not otherwise have had the opportunity to gain. Like Costain, we try to give back to the community.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new £32 million Walton Bridge, linking Walton-on-Thames and Shepperton, is the first new road bridge to span the River Thames in 20 years and will replace two temporary bridges that have been in use since 1953 and 1999. Around 34,000 cars use the current road crossings each weekday. The new bridge will be wider than the other crossings in order to allow for increased traffic flow.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">20 May 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A major milestone has been reached on the Costain project to build an underground electricity superhighway deep under London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Giant tunnel boring machine (TBM) ‘Cleopatra’ has completed an 8km drive from Eade Road in Haringey, north London, to St John’s Wood Substation, in the northwest of the metropolis . Together with earlier tunnelling by her ‘sister’ TBM, Evelyn, almost half of the planned 32km of the London Power Tunnels (LPT) project (Client: National Grid) has been completed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is creating new routes for 400kV high-voltage electricity cables beneath the capital, playing a vital role in ensuring Londoners have reliable power supplies for decades into the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cleopatra, a 400-tonne, 130-metre-long TBM (roughly the length of 12 London double-decker buses parked end-to-end) has carved a 4-metre diameter tunnel from Haringey, via Finsbury Park, Camden and Regents Park to St John’s Wood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the process she has removed 250,000m³ of earth, while some 36,000 concrete segments have been bolted together to form the new tunnel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A team of specialist tunnelling engineers sits within the length of the TBM, guiding it with literally inch-perfect precision to its destination.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This breakthrough is the culmination of nearly 18 months’ work for the entire team and demonstrates Costain’s ability to design, engineer and deliver projects that meet national needs,” said Andy Firth, Costain Project Manager.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“While the team is celebrating this success, this flagship project for National Grid has another 16km of tunnel to be completed and the team is already in the process of addressing this challenge and delivering the next milestone.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">National Grid’s Head of Cable Tunnels, David Luetchford, added: “This project is an excellent illustration of what National Grid is all about – helping keep people plugged into their power supplies.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Two Costain Water Sector projects, on behalf of Southern Water, have been shortlisted for the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) South East England Engineering Excellence Awards 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first project is Old Roar Gill at St Leonards-on-Sea, a £1.5 million scheme to reduce the risk of the sewage system overloading during storm conditions and to stop the pollution of local water course; the second project is Peacehaven Wastewater Treatment Works in Sussex, part of a £300 million environmental improvement scheme to bring cleaner seas to the Sussex coast. Both projects are being overseen by 4Delivery, a consortium consisting of Costain, Veolia Water and MWH.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A total of 10 infrastructure projects across East Sussex have been shortlisted. The Awards recognise the best civil engineering projects across the south east of England, with the judges looking for projects that deliver a real benefit to society through the knowledge, skills and professional expertise of civil engineers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Peacehaven Scheme includes a major new wastewater treatment works, two underground pumping stations and 11 kilometres of new sewer tunnels which will treat 95 million litres of wastewater. The area has been rated for its outstanding natural beauty, therefore designing a scheme that was able to blend in with the surrounding area has been a key priority for Costain and the 4D team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The winners will be announced on Friday 7th June at the ICE Kent and Sussex Awards Ceremony at Leeds Castle in Maidstone. The Awards will be presented with support from VolkerWesselsUK, 4D and Rochester Bridge Trust.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Laverty, the Director of ICE South East England, said: “ICE South East England’s Engineering Excellence Awards aims to recognise the very best infrastructure projects in the region and we are delighted with the quality of entries from across East Sussex. Having the right infrastructure is a key factor to generating economic success and publicly rewarding the people, organisations and businesses which deliver that infrastructure is important because of the benefits such civil engineering projects bring to the community.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">14 May 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firefighters from Merseyside Fire and Rescue were invited to carry out a training rescue operation at the Costain Welsh Water Heswall WwTW site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain team in north Wales is currently undertaking a £7million scheme to construct two large underground storage tanks at Heswall Wastewater Treatment Works and a satellite site at Riverbank Road. The project is part of the European Shellfish Waters Directive, which will improve the performance of wastewater treatment in the area by reducing the number of spills into the Dee Estuary, thus improving its water quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A crew from Heswall Community Fire station carried out various emergency training exercises to practice their response to a number of scenarios which they could potentially encounter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the storage tanks still under construction, the team carried out a drill which involved rescuing an ‘injured’ dummy by winching him up from the tank.  The aim of the training was to assess which equipment the team would use in the case of a rescue and to provide a real life scenario of rescuing people at height.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was a challenging operation due to the height of the tanks, which are 19 metres below ground.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Richard Heaps, Costain Project Manager said: “The team felt that the site provided an ideal opportunity for the Fire Service to carry out an emergency rescue drill. The visit has been extremely beneficial to our team who has been able to assess and validate the emergency access procedures that we have in place. It has also been reassuring to know that the local emergency services are fully trained in rescuing site operatives in this unique environment.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Madden, Costain Framework Director said: “Costain is happy to assist local emergency services in their preparations for unusual events. We would hope that the procedures would never be needed but we are reassured that, should the need occur, the emergency services have been trained.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">13 May 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gas from the new York field in the Southern North Sea is now flowing from Centrica’s offshore platform and associated undersea pipeline through its Easington Terminal and into the National Grid. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This has been achieved following the successful completion of the design and construction by Costain of the new onshore gas receiving and processing facility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Easington terminal, which already handles gas from the Rough gas storage field, was the site for a new process stream designed to handle up to 120 million ft³ a day natural gas output from the York field.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With overall North Sea oil and gas production dropping, new reserves are vital to help protect the UK’s energy security.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The approximate £80 million (TIC) on-shore element of the York project involved Costain providing design, procurement, construction management (as Principal Contractor) and commissioning support services for the new process stream in and around the existing operational facility – a major challenge as the Easington site is classified as a COMAH Tier 1 facility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“If you think of the existing facility as a straight line running from left to right, our new facility zigzagged across it at several points,” said Project Manager, Mark Buckingham, who steered the job through its last six months as its culmination neared.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We designed and installed a new gas receiving area, the new onshore York pipeline through the Easington site and a new process island inclusive of a Silica Gel drying operation along with a new emergency vent system for Easington site and York sales gas interface with the National Grid,” he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In an example of good housekeeping and sustainability, the project team was able to re-use some redundant process stream equipment from the older Amethyst Field flow, which also previously came ashore at Easington.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first gas flowed on 26 March, a few days after Costain demobilised from the project after having been on-site since September 2011. Work on final commissioning and fine-tuning of the new facility continues by the Centrica Operations team.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">9 May 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deadline day is approaching for completion of a major project in Wales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Pontypridd regeneration project includes a full refurbishment of its public areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project has been undertaken for an established Costain client, Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council (RCTCBC). Originally a town that flourished with the surrounding coal industry, the decline of mining badly affected the town. A large, twice-weekly town centre market had also experienced a decline in customers over recent years and the regeneration programme is intended to significantly enhance the public realm of the historic town setting and attract visitors back. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The council was able to get the revitalisation project underway around two years ago after winning financial backing from the Welsh Government and the Welsh European Funding Office.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A major challenge has been the topography of the town, a long, linear urban environment with narrow streets. Costain had to undertake the refurbishment while keeping thoroughfares open, particularly so that deliveries and pedestrians could have access to shops.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work has included laying high-quality granite footpaths and pavements, new benches, bins, lighting – even an element of artwork.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As well as the physical work, “We’ve done a massive amount of work in terms of community involvement,” said Community Relations Manager, Brian Greaves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“In partnership with RCTCBC we’ve created a DVD of the project with Pontypridd High School, produced four newsletters, sponsored Ponty’s Big Weekend pop concert for the last two years and again this year (including major acts like JLS, Olly Murs and The Wanted) and undertaken many community initiatives.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These have included raising more than £15,000 for Cystic Fibrosis, while the team’s efforts to keep the town centre navigable to the community earned them a Bronze Considerate Constructors Award last year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One novel initiative undertaken by the team was to canvass every shopkeeper at the start of the project, to create a database of names of managers and key staff, plus their telephone numbers. Around 80% of the town’s shopkeepers signed up and were sent regular text messages to keep them up-to-date with any potential construction disruption in their streets.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">9 May 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has won a national award for Building Information Management (BIM), three years before it becomes a requirement on all publicly-funded Government projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group has been making increasing use of BIM and at Building magazine’s annual awards, it received the ‘BIM Initiative of the Year’ title. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The award was given for its use of BIM on the London Bridge Station project, where it is applying ‘augmented reality’ on tablet computers issued to staff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using augmented reality, a computer is held up to an object or part of the sight, its camera streams what it can see and the field of view is overlaid with information gleaned from a database. For example, at London Bridge personnel can see how areas of the site will look when temporary works or hoardings are in place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At London Bridge, Costain has applied two different approaches to augmented reality – image recognition (identifying location based upon a photographic survey, working with Inition) and ‘point cloud data’, using a laser scan with an embedded three-dimensional model into the image, working closely with Network Rail and supplier Plowman Craven.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has also been awarded £70,000 funding from the Technology Strategy Board to research the application of augmented reality to Asset Management - if the tablet is held up to a component it will recognise the item, and a linked database will tell the viewer when it was last maintained, who maintained it, when it is next due for attention, plus a method statement for doing it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The judges also noted that Costain was bringing the benefits of the system to the maximum number of people by involving both its supply chain and the client, Network Rail. It was looking at this bigger picture, as well as the specific aspects of the technology’s use at London Bridge, that helped Costain clinch the title.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Competition was tough, said Head of BIM, Matt Blackwell, with both customers and competitors involved in the category.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">8 May 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain Group officially launches a major new initiative at the Company’s AGM in London today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Engineering Tomorrow is Costain’s commitment to identifying, developing and implementing innovative solutions to meet the UK’s major national infrastructure needs. Over the last 12-18 months, Costain has implemented a number of schemes that aim to enhance the quality of project delivery, develop the skills and ideas of its people, and, more crucially, provide cost-effective solutions, all in support of Engineering Tomorrow. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Start-Up is one such example. Launched in 2012, its aim was to create and support innovative business ideas from across the Company. Employees were invited to submit their business ideas and as a result, ‘Mario’ (Mass Asset Recognition and Intelligent Optimisation), an asset management tool, is now being sold commercially to rail and highways customers in addition to Costain’s range of services.  The subsequent launch of Blue Innovation Futures has opened a similar scheme to innovators, entrepreneurs, businesses and members of the general public.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Engineering Tomorrow relies on sharing knowledge and applying best practice across the Group. To support this, the Company recently launched The Costain Way, which uses the broad range of skills and knowledge within the Company to further strengthen best practice and reflect the diversity of its business, including its growing support services related activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Engineering Tomorrow means providing cutting edge advanced technological solutions. Working with the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority to address the UK’s nuclear legacy, the Company is undertaking research and development into Plasma Vitrification and Graphite Gasification technologies as potential solutions for the treatment and storage of intermediate level nuclear waste. The technology has the potential to cut waste and produce cost savings of £4.3 billion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s stakeholders, including its shareholders and the communities it serves, are also an important component of Engineering Tomorrow. The Company’s Costain Cares programme aims to address the growing needs of its stakeholders through greater corporate responsibility, including health and safety, professional development and reducing the environmental impact of its business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Cares underpins Costain’s role as an active member of Business in the Community (BITC) by supporting its goal of creating jobs and helping every young person, particularly those facing social disadvantage, to receive support from business to build a successful working life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The health and safety of its employees and wider stakeholders is paramount. The Group now employs its own third party accredited Costain Behavioural Safety programme (CBS) on all of its projects where it is used to create an environment where, through exhibiting leadership, everyone has an understanding of their own behaviour and how it impacts on others. The fundamental principles of this highly successful programme are now being used in a wider Behavioural Management and Leadership Programme, applying it to all aspects of the business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of these schemes support Costain’s Engineering Tomorrow strategy, which recognises that to satisfy the national need, the Company needs to invest in technology, formulate innovative solutions, devise new ways of doing things and pass on crucial knowledge, both internally and to its partners and customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Engineering Tomorrow is our commitment to identifying, developing and implementing innovative solutions to meet major national infrastructure needs. We place high priority on innovation and this can clearly be seen in our technological and organisational initiatives, as well as our skills-based training and our bid to be more socially responsible to the needs of our stakeholders. Engineering Tomorrow is delivering today,” said Alan Kay, Costain’s Group Technical &amp; Operations Director.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">8 May 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, one of the UK's leading tier one engineering solutions providers, delivering integrated consulting, project delivery and operations and maintenance services, announces its Interim Management Statement covering the period from 1 January 2013 to the current date. The Group is holding its Annual General Meeting later today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Update</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following its good performance in 2012, the Group has had a strong start to the current year and is performing in line with the Board's expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is continuing to secure new work from major blue-chip customers who are investing billions of pounds in capital, operations and maintenance contracts and who require increasingly innovative solutions to their complex requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s success in identifying, developing and implementing innovative solutions to meet those customer requirements is demonstrated in the following examples of new work won since the start of the year:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- In anticipation of Network Rail’s £9.4 billion investment in electrifying Britain’s railways, Costain established a joint venture to develop a range of innovative solutions that would directly meet the customer’s requirements. As a result, the Group announced that it had won the West Coast Power Supply Upgrade contract, its first contract as part of a circa £300 million investment by Network Rail in power upgrade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- As a consequence of an intense focus on understanding the customer’s specific needs, the Group secured, in joint venture, a further four contracts from Crossrail. The latest awards include the very important circa. £300m contract to design, fit-out and commission the railway systems across Crossrail’s tunnel network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- By implementing new service attributes, innovation and performance enhancement into an existing contract, the Group was recently awarded by the Highways Agency a two-year extension to its Managing Agent Contractor Area 7 maintenance contract.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Following the successful completion earlier this year of the engineering design, procurement and construction management at Centrica's Easington Gas Terminal, enabling the production of gas from the York field in the Southern North Sea, we have received a repeat order from Centrica for the front end engineering design (FEED) at the Barrow terminals which service the East Irish Sea gas fields.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br /><strong>Order book</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a result of new contract awards and extensions the Group’s quality forward order book has increased to £2.5 billion (31 December 2012: £2.4 billion), of which over 90% is repeat orders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, the Group has also increased its preferred bidder position to over £500 million (31 December 2012: over £400m).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To date, over £800 million of revenue has been secured for 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The overall level of tendering activity across the Group's targeted markets remains high.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Financial position</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group continues to benefit from a robust financial position with a strong net cash position.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In its full-year results announcement the Group highlighted that net cash would trend lower as the Group benefits from its increased emphasis on support service related activities and on customers who increasingly utilise a target cost based form of contract, together with changing industry cash flow profiles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Proposed all-share merger with May Gurney Integrated Services plc (‘May Gurney’)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Boards of Costain and May Gurney announced on 26 March 2013 that they had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended all-share merger of Costain and May Gurney (the ‘Proposed Merger’).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On 24 April 2013, the Boards of Kier Group plc (‘Kier’) and May Gurney announced that they had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended offer for May Gurney by Kier (the ‘Kier Offer’). At the time of such announcement, the value of the Kier Offer represented a premium of approximately 35 per cent. to the then value of the Proposed Merger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On 25 April 2013, Costain announced that, having undertaken several months of detailed due diligence, it did not believe that it would be in the best interests of Costain shareholders for Costain to amend the terms of the Proposed Merger, that it would not be making a revised offer for May Gurney and that it intended to lapse the Proposed Merger at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accordingly, the Proposed Merger is expected to lapse, in accordance with its terms, on 29 May 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group incurred transaction costs of approximately £4m (pre-tax) associated with the May Gurney proposal and these will be expensed in the first half results and treated as a one-off non trading item.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Outlook</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s continuing progress, despite challenging economic conditions, is a reflection of the Group’s strategic focus on meeting the complex needs of customers by providing an integrated consulting, project delivery and operations and maintenance capability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group believes that, driven by innovation, the strategic development of the business will be accelerated as we work with customers on their future programmes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With strong financial resources and an increased order book, the Board remains confident of meeting its expectations in 2013.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">7 May 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s planning community is materially helping drive forward project performance for customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Planners are now more visibly involved in projects, said Group Technical Director, Bill Hewlett, speaking after the annual Costain Group planning conference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“When we began this conference a few years ago we talked about issues such as the type of software we should use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This year was 100% externally-focused, looking at the ways our planners are innovating to make a difference to the core performance of the Company. The focus was very much on the bonus it could bring to our customers’ businesses.”<br />He described the planning community as “The guys who glue everything together. They’re the mortar.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among clients present at the conference was one of the planners’ opposite numbers at a major client. Bill said the guest complimented his audience, noting their experience and the support their work received from elsewhere in the Company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The annual event brings together planners from across the Group to exchange best practice, said Head of Planning, Brendan Johnston.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The problem is getting planners together, as they tend to be ‘deeply embedded on their individual projects.” The conference aimed to break down barriers, he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A major topic under discussion at the conference, held at Woodland Grange conference centre near Leamington Spa, was ‘best practice &amp; lean construction’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Speakers gave presentations on how this was being employed at Brighton &amp; Hove, Heathrow Airport and London Bridge Station, as well as the experience of using lean construction techniques on the much-praised Bidston Moss Viaduct refurbishment project on The Wirral.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Matt Lumm talked on planning in Natural Resources, while several project managers and Business Improvement Director, Tony Blanch, also attended to provide a cross-section of representation from the Group.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It was a very useful day,” said Brendan. “We all learned a lot.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">2 May 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crossrail contractors Costain Skanska have turned their hand to catering and volunteered their time at a Paddington women’s homeless shelter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team of ten construction workers cooked and shared a three course meal with thirty women residing at the Marylebone Project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The volunteer effort is the first in several planned events where the Paddington Crossrail team will work with local homeless shelters and social housing programmes to help deliver tangible benefits to the local community. The work is part of Crossrail’s Community Investment Programme which requires contractors delivering Crossrail works to support the communities in which they are working.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Skanska Project Director, Martin Quaid, who was one of the volunteers, said: “We are really pleased to have the opportunity to work within the local community. Costain Skanska is keen to leave a lasting legacy on the community that we work in, not only in the form of a new station but also for our team to engage in the local community.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crossrail Project Manager for Paddington, Ben Hardy, said: “Crossrail will be working at Paddington for the next five years, and is committed to playing a responsible part in the life of the community. Our Community Investment Programme will leave a legacy far beyond the life of the construction works, and help set the standard for future projects.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rosie Cripps, the Co-ordinator for Time for Paddington, said: “Efforts such as these by Crossrail help our residents to come together and feel part of a community.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Marylebone Project is a partnership between Church Army and the Portman House Trust and works with vulnerable homeless women with the aim to empower them towards independent living.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sainsbury’s kindly supplied most of the ingredients and to add some luxury for our dining guests the Paddington Hilton hotel supplied the tableware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">About Crossrail:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The total funding envelope available to deliver Crossrail is £14.8bn.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Crossrail route will pass through 37 stations and run 118 km (73 miles) from Maidenhead and Heathrow in the west, through new twin-bore 21 km (13 miles) tunnels below central London to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Crossrail opens it will increase London's rail-based transport network capacity by 10%, supporting regeneration and cutting journey times across the city. Crossrail services are due to commence through central London in 2018.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crossrail is being delivered by Crossrail Limited (CRL). CRL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London. Crossrail is jointly sponsored by the Department for Transport and Transport for London.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">1 May 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A pioneering partnership between Path Intelligence and Costain will solve problems facing the travel and transport industries by using data insights into crowd behaviour to maximise operational efficiency, optimise maintenance activity and boost retail returns for asset owners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Path Intelligence’s unique footfall mapping technology and Costain’s expertise in building and maintaining transport assets, join forces in the creation of COpath, an asset intelligence resource supported by major investment from both companies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COpath provides real data to smooth the flow of visitors by tackling jams, bottlenecks and opposing traffic flows.  A key benefit of this data is to enable capacity to be optimised as an alternative to large capital investment.  The disruption and costs of maintenance work can also be minimized by using COpath data to pinpoint optimum times to schedule work. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The technology also provides insights into the impact of planned and unplanned disruptions such as scheduled construction work, or unexpected equipment failures, whilst tracking crowd evacuation movement can also inform critical emergency planning decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The expertise of Path Intelligence in retail environments will support commercially important decisions by providing insights into the impact of advertising and marketing campaigns and pinpoint ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ retail units to influence rental values.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ross Agnew, Costain Group Strategy Director, comments: “Demand for transport is increasing and to be able to afford to meet that demand we need to be optimising how we use our assets and maximising revenue opportunities. Gaining more intelligence on how transport systems are used is essential to achieving this; Path Intelligence’s technology provides this intelligence.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">30 April 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crossrail contractor Costain Skanska Joint Venture (JV) has completed the construction of the diaphragm walls and columns that will support the roof of the new Crossrail Paddington Station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work started on the project in April 2012 to construct a 40 metre deep reinforced concrete wall around the perimeter of the new station. Crossrail, Costain Skanska JV and subcontractor Cementation Skanska worked round the clock for 11 months to put in place the 165 individual diaphragm wall panels and 51 plunge columns to form a box 265 metres long and 22.5 metres wide.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The completed walls, which are made up of 165 rectangular panels measuring 3.3 metres in length, 1.2 metres in width and 40 metres deep, required over 64,000 tonnes of concrete and 5,000 tonnes of steel in their construction. The excavation of the panels saw over 53,000 tonnes of London clay removed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project wasn’t without its challenges, particularly due to the restricted space the site team had to work in. The tunnel boring machines that are being used to construct the new train tunnels had to pass through the walls of the station as part of their journey between Royal Oak and Farringdon, which meant the team had to meet tight deadlines. Each boring machine measures 150 metres long - roughly equivalent to 14 London buses placed end to end - and weighs around 1,000 tonnes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“One of the biggest challenges we encountered was completing the required minimum proportion of wall ahead of the approaching tunnel boring machines. A failure to get this done on time would have meant serious delays elsewhere on the programme,” said Rupert Shingleton, Costain’s Project Director. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the outer walls were completed, the team then put in place 60 metres by 1.8 metres diameter central columns to support to the station roof and provide ground anchorage to the box.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new Crossrail Paddington Station will be 260 metres long, 30 metres wide and 30 metres deep and will provide step free access to platform level along with an interchange with National Rail and London Underground. Eastbourne Terrace, a main road that serves Paddington Station, will be reopened once the work has finished, with a target date set for February 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are delighted to have reached this milestone in the construction of the new Crossrail Paddington Station. Everyone involved has worked incredibly hard to get the job done on time and safely, which has enabled progress to go ahead as planned elsewhere on our neighbouring Crossrail contracts. We can now turn our attention to constructing the station roof slab which in turn releases two major work fronts. We are now focusing on reopening of Eastbourne Terrace in February 2014 and beginning excavation down to the platforms,” Rupert said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Crossrail route will pass through 37 stations and run 118 km (73 miles) from Maidenhead and Heathrow in the west, through new twin-bore 21 km (13 miles) tunnels to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Crossrail opens it will increase London's rail-based transport network capacity by 10%, support regeneration and cut journey times across the city. Crossrail services are due to commence through central London in 2018.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">29 April 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Water Sector team has become a member of the Smart Water Networks Forum (SWAN), an international organisation that uses data technologies to try and shape the future distribution of water more efficiently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As water supplies decrease and pressure on the UK’s water networks increases, smarter management of existing assets is becoming increasingly important. A smart water network, or water IT, uses data-driven software and components to automatically optimise the performance of reservoirs, pumps, water and wastewater treatment plants and distribution pipes. Membership of SWAN reinforces Costain’s commitment to bringing innovative and cost effective solutions to its water customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has a Gold membership of the forum, which denotes the size of the Company. Membership of SWAN gives Costain the opportunity to collaborate with other industry leading corporations and individuals, both nationally and internationally, to work towards the improved efficiency, longevity and reliability of water networks around the world. Examples of other high profile members are ABB, CISCO, TaKaDu, Siemens, Talis and Grundfos, as well as water providers and treatment specialists from across the globe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With rapid development in wireless technologies and data monitoring hardware, Smart Networks is at the forefront of the innovation movement in the water sector globally. The use of data technologies has been widely used in the economy for years, from oil and gas to electricity utilities, but it’s relatively new in the water sector, said Graham Keegan, Costain’s Water Sector Director.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Smart networks are composed of sensors that collect and transmit field data to central computers, where the information is then sorted and analysed by sophisticated software. The computer system then makes decisions about supply and demand and automatically sends out commands to valves, switches and pumps in order to fine-tune the network. The benefits include fewer leaks and spills, reduced energy consumption, longer infrastructure life, and lower operating costs,” said Graham.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SWAN’s mission is “to connect and represent a global network of water professionals engaged with Smart Water Network approaches, in order to promote the development and adoption of data driven systems for better water network management and operation.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During 2013, SWAN has three ongoing workgroups: Smart Water Network Architecture – focused around mapping of systems; Data Protocols &amp; Structure – focused around standardisation; and Investors, Utilities &amp; Entrepreneurs – focused around alignment of innovative solutions with investment and opportunities to trial. Collectively these groups will work towards providing clear targets for development and strategy in this area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are delighted to be associated with SWAN which gives us an excellent platform to exchange ideas and promote a better understanding about how we can meet the changing demands of water usage in the future,” said Graham.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>25 April 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A “monumental piece of work” has brought the completion of Reading rail station’s refurbishment a year closer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A week of reduced services over the recent holiday week, bookended by a four-day Easter closure and a further weekend stoppage, allowed as many as 2,000 personnel from several organisations – 500 from Costain and its contractors –  to swarm over the station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Much of the work involved Network Rail (NR) and its contractors commissioning a major new signalling system and track works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the blockade of the rail lines that this entailed enabled Costain’s efforts to be dovetailed into it, said Project Director, Brian Fisher.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The station is undergoing a £100 million renewal, part of a £895 million project to improve the rail network in the Reading area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It was the biggest blockade that Network Rail has done for many years,” said Brian. “All through lines were closed for four days over Easter and for the following weekend and only a few platforms were available for customers for the following week.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s main tasks were to demolish an old bridge over the tracks, open five new platforms on the north side of the station and refurbish a further two.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Refurbishment took the form of construction of platform buildings, plus new platform surfacing and canopies. “It looks completely different,” said Brian. “It’s gone from being a dated station to a very high-tech one.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The old bridge has been replaced by a much higher capacity ‘transfer deck’ that links into large new concourses on the north and south sides of the station and has a total of nineteen new escalators down to individual platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NR’s planning meant that the Easter work effectively cut a year off the project’s initially-envisaged completion date; it has also done away with the need for 20 weekend closures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It was a monumental piece of work,” said Brian “and we’ve had an awful lot of congratulations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“David Higgins, NR’s Chief Executive, wrote: ‘Congratulations on the enormous amount of effort over the last week-and-a-half and on the successful opening this morning. Please pass on my great thanks to the rest of your team.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“And Robbie Burns, NR’s Wales &amp; West Director, added: ‘I’m immensely proud to be associated with the Reading project and, more importantly, with the team that delivered it. It’s a wonderful result but nothing less than you deserve.’”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">23 April 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A-one+, a joint venture between Costain, Colas and Halcrow, recently hosted a Media Day to showcase a number of road safety initiatives in MAC Area 14 in the north east of England.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Regional Roadworker Safety Event took place in Swalwell, Gateshead and was attended by the media, designers and operatives from A-one+ as well as the Highways Agency’s Chief Executive, Graham Dalton and Highways Agency’s Regional Director, Vanessa Gilbert.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The day was organised to show how road maintenance work is undertaken in the north east, the dangers that exist in a highways environment and how those dangers can be reduced by implementing innovative and cost effective solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the innovations on show included:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span><strong>Intellicone</strong></span><br />An award winning, low cost technology that turns ordinary traffic cones into an intelligent wireless network that can activate an alarm and report any perimeter breaches from an oncoming vehicle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span><strong>The Simplified Traffic Management system</strong></span><br />This reduces the number of signs set out in advance of a lane closure, with High Level Signs (HLS) displaying ‘Lane Closed Ahead’ signs on vehicles using high level LED displays. The initiative was devised in conjunction with the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) as part of the Highways Agency’s “Aiming for Zero” strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span><strong>The Intelligent TM Crash Cushion </strong></span><br />This records what is happening behind a team of road workers and can sound an alarm to warn the operatives and the approaching vehicle of an imminent collision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The effectiveness of these initiatives can be seen in the contribution they have made to Area 14’s exemplary safety record. The A-one+ team has achieved one million man-hours without a reportable accident and 750,000 man hours , or 9 out of 12 rolling months, without any accident taking place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Karen Gaunt, the Customer and Community Relations Manager on the scheme, said: “This was a fantastic opportunity for the media to meet some of our staff and to see some of the innovations we have implemented to improve road safety.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A-one+ is the MAC Contractor for the Highways Agency in Areas 7, 12 and 14, maintaining the trunk roads and motorway from Scotland down to Oxford, or roughly 25% of the national network. Area 14 includes Durham, Northumberland, North Yorkshire and Tyne and Wear.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">22 April 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Group PLC has been recognised with the highest ranking in Business in the Community’s (BITC) annual benchmark of responsible business management, the Corporate Responsibility Index (CR Index).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The CR Index is the UK’s leading and most in-depth voluntary benchmark of corporate responsibility. It has been run by Business in the Community for over a decade to help companies; accurately measure and manage all aspects of their social and environmental performance; shape how they integrate and improve corporate responsibility throughout their business operations and benchmark themselves against competitors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Group PLC was announced as a Platinum Big Tick company, a new banding in the Index for 2013  designed to challenge leading companies with ‘stretch questions’ on topics such as their long-term planning and the unique contribution their business can make to create transformational change and a  sustainable economy. The announcement had been timed to coincide with Responsible Business Week (15-19 April 2013) an initiative taking place across the UK this week to raise public awareness of the powerful, positive role of business in society.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite the ongoing economic challenges facing business, the 2013 CR Index paints a positive picture of levels of commitment to responsible business in the UK.  Participating companies achieved a high average score of 90% indicating that companies are continuing to overcoming commercial pressures to maintain their investment in and engagement with responsible business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Achieving Platinum Big Tick means that Costain can demonstrate that it is thinking about how global mega trends, such as population growth and resource scarcity, are affecting the future strategy of the business. The banding is an indication that it is making long-term investments to improve or launch new environmentally and socially sound products and services, and is embedding responsible values throughout the workforce.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Catherine Warbrick, Corporate Responsibility Director at Costain, said: “We are delighted to achieve Platinum Big Tick status in this year's BITC CR Index. Through Costain Cares, our Corporate Responsibility Strategy and vision to build a long-term sustainable business that creates economic, environmental and social value, we have continued to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to embed responsible business practices across the Group.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stephen Howard, Chief Executive, Business in the Community, said: “The CR Index tells us that, despite the complexities of this agenda and the tough economic challenges they’re facing, our leading companies are continuing to invest in responsible business and truly integrate it within their operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Responsible business matters – to businesses, employees, communities and the long term sustainability of the planet. As we launch the UK’s first Responsible Business Week to celebrate the powerful positive role business plays in society, this Index is a key tool to help the public to understand what good business looks like while also providing examples to inspire many more companies to accelerate the pace of change within their business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"I congratulate Costain for achieving Platinum Big Tick because it signifies a key step on the journey, a willingness to rise to the challenge and that they are part of a movement of responsible business in which all companies have their unique part to play. We look forward on working with, supporting and challenging Costain to build on this achievement as we, together drive the transformational change needed to deliver a sustainable economy.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ends</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>About the CR Index</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Business in the Community's CR Index is the UK’s leading voluntary benchmark of corporate responsibility. It helps companies to integrate and improve CR throughout their operations by providing a systematic approach to managing, measuring and reporting on business impacts in society and on the environment. For over a decade the CR Index has inspired and challenged over 360 companies to continuously improve their impact on society and the environment. The CR Index scores participating companies against the following areas of responsible business, Corporate Strategy, Community Management, Environmental Management, Marketplace Management, Workplace management. Environmental Impact and Social Impact. This year over 100 companies participated publicly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A <strong>Platinum Big Tick </strong>company demonstrates that it has started thinking about how the global mega trends, such as population growth and resource scarcity, are affecting the future strategy of the business. Platinum Big Tick companies tend to make long-term investments to improve current or launch new environmentally and socially sound product and/or services, whose return on investment may not be immediate. Furthermore, these companies generally ensure that their vision and values are lived and embedded throughout the entire workforce and that senior managers and board members’ training is conversant with a sustainable growing economy.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">19 April 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crossrail’s Paddington station contractor Costain Skanska Joint Venture (JV) has facilitated more than 48,000 deliveries to the station’s retailers in the past year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The deliveries to the 32 Paddington station businesses, including Sainsbury’s, Marks &amp; Spencers and WH Smiths, were previously made via Departures Road (off Eastbourne Terrace). This road has since been converted into a major construction site to build Crossrail’s Paddington station, one of nine new stations being built across the route in London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crossrail worked closely with Network Rail to find a solution that included Costain Skanska JV developing a full management plan to manage all the deliveries to Paddington station including a booking system and lorry holding area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Skanska JV and Crossrail have worked closely with retailers to communicate the changes which included receiving deliveries to the station entrance next to the Hilton Hotel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work for the construction of the new Crossrail station started in February 2012. The station is being constructed under Eastbourne Terrace and once the main station structure is completed, Eastbourne Terrace will be restored above and reopened in 2014. The station construction will be completed in 2018.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">17 April 2014</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is among a group of organisations that includes De Montfort University, Bluefrog Design, M Wright and Sons, Virtalis and Loxcius that has secured co-funding from the government-backed Technology Strategy Board for a project aimed at improving the Company’s operational performance and service delivery at Severn Trent Water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Technology Strategy Board, the UK’s innovation agency, works to stimulate technology-enabled innovation in areas that offer the greatest scope for boosting the UK’s growth and productivity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Central to the three-year project involving Costain plus manufacturing firms M Wright &amp; Sons and Bluefrog Design is the Autonomous Model Development software Tool (AMDT).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The AMDT will work like a closed loop control system, where changes are constantly assessed and their effects fed back into the loop. The ultimate aim is to produce more reactive and competent processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s still very early days,” says Costain’s Business Development Director for the Water Sector, Matt Crabtree. “The background to the project is to make British industry more efficient. The collaborative research and development project uses Costain’s and other collaborators’ processes to generate a requirement specification for the AMDT and as sites for validating the project outputs.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the purposes of the study, Costain’s maintenance and repair work for Severn Trent is under the microscope. “For example,” says Matt, “we repair hand-railings across Severn Trent sites. We do a lot of these jobs, but they are all slightly different. It’s a case of how we can streamline the process by using these innovative technologies to make it more efficient.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Monitoring resources through simulation provided by Loxcius and rehearsing tasks in Virtalis’ virtual environments will increase our effectiveness and feed back into planning,” adds David Cockburn-Price, managing director of Virtalis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We don’t think of ourselves as a manufacturing business and Professor David Stockton of De Montfort University suggested we compare ourselves to Morgan Cars,” says Matt. “All Morgan’s sports cars have four wheels and an engine, but they are built to custom order – in many ways, a similar situation to our hand-railing jobs. The fundamentals are similar but the shape and fixing differ.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Coping with those differences – for example, in the form of problems or changes to an individual project – is the aim of the AMDT,” says Professor Stockton.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even a small change or problem, such as equipment breakdown, or a client changing a deadline, can have lengthy knock-on effects, he explains. AMDT is aimed at helping a company’s planners make better judgements by using causal links across processes to autonomously resolve the effects of these problems and find best solutions to them.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>16 April 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Three young staff members’ efforts to seize the opportunities offered by Costain’s training were marked at the AGM and dinner of Costain’s 21 Club*.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They became this year’s recipients of the Sir Albert Costain Memorial Awards. Sir Albert, who believed passionately in development through training, endowed the prizes, which go to staff who are deemed to have made the most of the training available to them. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This year’s winners were Sinead Egan, currently working as a SHE advisor on the Area 12 Managing Agent Contract for the Highways Agency covering Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire; apprentice accountant Luke Fisher, working on the Severn Trent AMP 5 framework; and fellow trainee accountant James Hawkes, who operates on the Central Work-Winning Team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sinead was the first graduate to achieve membership of the Institute of Occupational Safety, while Luke was described by AMP 5 Framework Director Ritchie Burcombe as someone whose enthusiasm and willingness to learn made him “a real asset to the framework”. James was described in his nomination as “always keen to assist” and “always keen to develop improvements”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each received a certificate and a cheque for £250. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The AGM attracted 140 guests to London’s famous Oval cricket ground. Among senior Costain personnel attending were Chairman David Allvey, Chief Executive Andrew Wyllie and HR Director Fiona Ware.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*The 21 Club is open to any staff member who has completed 18 years with the Group. Membership is currently stable at around 700.  </p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>15 April 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, one of the UK’s leading tier one engineering solutions providers, is pleased to announce that ATC (‘ATC’), its Joint Venture with Alstom and TSO, has been awarded a contract worth approximately £300m to design, fit-out and commission the railway systems in Crossrail’s tunnel network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under the contract, ATC will design and install track, overhead lines and mechanical and electrical equipment to fit out the 21km of twin tunnels currently being bored under the streets of London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Design work will commence immediately, with the fit-out works starting in 2014, and will be carried out within the entire tunnelled and surface sections of the Crossrail route between Royal Oak, Pudding Mill Lane and Plumstead Portals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is also pleased to announce that in Joint Venture with Alstom it has been awarded the £15m contract for the design, construction and commissioning of the system that will provide traction power for the trains in the central tunnelled section of the Crossrail scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work will involve the construction of several auto–transformer stations and a feeder station site at Pudding Mill Lane to provide a 25 kV supply to the overhead line equipment that will power the new Crossrail trains. Costain is also constructing for National Grid the new cable tunnels to provide power to the other Crossrail feeder station at Kensal Green.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crossrail will open in 2018. The Crossrail route will pass through 37 stations and will increase London's rail-based transport network capacity by 10 per cent. An estimated 200 million people will travel on Crossrail each year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive of Costain, commented,</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“The Crossrail scheme is providing a much-needed solution to upgrading a key part of the nation’s travel infrastructure. We are delighted to have been awarded these contracts, which follow on from other Crossrail projects we are involved in, including the construction of the Bond Street and Paddington stations and works at Eleanor Street and Mile End Park.

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">10 April 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain personnel working in joint venture (jv) with Skanska on the Crossrail Paddington Station project are encouraging local school pupils to fulfil their potential and to consider construction as a career choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Staff are helping to boost the prospects of a group of pupils enrolled in a ‘Science academy’ at nearby college Paddington Academy. Together with several other organisations, including AstraZeneca, John Laing and the Science Museum, the Costain Skanska jv is providing personnel to give advice and practical help to the 16 and 17-year-olds. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s our opportunity to try to promote engineering,” said James York, Costain’s Community Relations Manager on the project, which is creating a new station box for the new underground station beside the west London terminal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are four strands to the help the project is providing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some staff will become mentors, meeting pupils assigned to them for an hour every few weeks to learn about the challenges they are facing and offering encouragement and careers advice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Others will visit the academy as guest lecturers, while the pupils will get the chance to become interns. This will involve real duties with tangible results. “It will also give them a feel for what it’s like to get paid,” said James.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, the project is offering site visits. This is one area where the Company has an advantage, said James. “That’s one thing some of the other companies really struggled with. A lot of them only have offices and the pupils would struggle to get something out of that. But they came here, saw a live site and got a talk from one of the engineers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“A few people who had previously said ‘I definitely want to be a doctor’ came away from the visit thinking: ‘Perhaps I would like to be project director of a civil engineering project.’”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain Skanska joint venture project has also struck up links with other schools in the area, offering practical help for youngsters about to enter the employment market by helping them compile CVs and giving them hints on interview techniques.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">8 April 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain Highways Sector Team secured a four-year service contract from the Welsh Government in October 2012 to maintain IT and electrical assets on all Welsh motorways and trunk roads. The project was formally launched on 31 January.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’re delighted to have secured the contract that is the first of its kind for the Highways Sector,” said Mobilisation Manager, James Bulleid. “Our driving priority in setting up the new business has been to create a highly-motivated, efficient and technically skilful team that is well supported and equipped to maintain the road infrastructure to the highest standards required by the Welsh Government.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Contract Manager, Phil Davies, leads the team, which has been divided between two operating centres: Treforest, near Cardiff, managed by Philip Meecham and Kinmel Bay in North Wales, managed by Ian Billington.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A fully-integrated approach to service delivery has been adopted, with Costain staff co-located and co-ordinating the work activity from the client’s offices in the Wales Traffic Centres in Coryton and Llandudno Junction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Advanced, application-based technology and tablet computers have been introduced to boost efficiency and eliminate paperwork. The process will also provide a detailed log of the varied assets on the motorways and trunk roads managed by the Welsh Government and create a more proactive approach to asset management and maintenance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 32-strong technology team includes managers, engineers, technicians and apprentices who have transferred under TUPE rules to Costain. Team members bring with them a broad range of specialist skills covering CCTV, M&amp;E, electrical and IT system installation and maintenance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“There is a huge level of enthusiasm for the new and positive changes that are being made to service delivery and adopting an analytical approach to asset management,” commented Phil. “The team is up for the challenge and we are excited about delivering on our promises.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>4 April 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain and the Cambridge Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction (CCISC) at Cambridge University are working on a new initiative for National Grid’s London Power Tunnels (LPT) project that could make construction of a tunnel with concrete segmental linings more efficient.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The LPT project involves carving out 32km of tunnels under the capital to help ensure Londoners keep on enjoying safe and reliable electricity supplies decades into the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain approached the CCISC to investigate possible innovations that could be used on the project. The use of optical fibres that could be embedded within the concrete tunnel segments to measure axial and bending strain levels of the tunnel lining in a distributed manner emerged as the innovation with greatest potential.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These instruments would be used to collect data that would help the university researchers understand how tunnel linings perform during and after construction, with the aim of using these measurements to assess potential efficiency savings in construction of the tunnel segments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Six pre-cast, steel fibre-reinforced concrete segments bolted together form a tunnel ring, which in turn forms the tunnel lining.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the segments for one of the four-metre diameter tunnels currently being dug for the LPT project 250mm thick, any viable reduction in their thickness indicated by the sensors could save thousands of cubic metres of concrete over the course of a major contract, together with a corresponding reduction in the amount of ground material to be removed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">LPT project team members are working with the CCISC on a trial of the new distributed optical fibre strain measurement system. The optical fibre sensors were cast into the centre of the segments in February and are being installed this spring on the tunnel drive between Eade Road to St John’s Wood in northwest London. Further instrumented sections will be installed on another section of the route, between Eade Road and Hackney, east London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Data will be collected over a 12 to 18-month period and analysed to see if redesigning the sections would bring efficiency savings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Trounson, National Grid’s Senior Project Manager on the London Power Tunnels project said: “National Grid always looks for efficient and innovative ways to deliver our vital work in connecting people to their energy supplies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These new innovations we’re trialling on our project have the potential to create big savings on costs and resources in the future.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">3 April 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has been awarded a Silver Award for Contractor Safety Excellence 2012 by Drax Power Ltd for its work on an industrial cooling project at Drax Power Station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The awards were listed in two safety categories: for those contractors that have worked up to 25,000 man-hours, and for those that have worked over 25,000 man-hours. Costain was nominated for working up to 25,000 man-hours for its work on an industrial cooling project that was successfully delivered last year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaun Smith, Costain Senior Supervisor on the project, attended the Drax Safety Conference in Leeds to receive the award.  Drax praised Costain for its commitment to Health and Safety and its continued improvement year on year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Our working relationship with Drax Power has developed over many years. We have worked on a number of specialist cooling tower repair and maintenance contracts and, in all cases, striving to achieve an excellent health and safety record has been a number one priority,” said Shaun.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mark Blackham, Industrial Cooling Director, added: “My team and I are delighted to now be in our fourth year without a Lost Time Accident. This award reflects our continual commitment to Health and Safety and the importance of behaving the right way, all of the time, on our projects.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">2 April 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project to redevelop London’s Farringdon Tube and Thameslink  rail station  has picked up two CEEQUAL awards. The £290million contract took the Outstanding Achievement Award for Ecology and Biodiversity and was highly commended in the Historic Environment category.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CEEQUAL is the assessment and awards scheme for improving sustainability in civil engineering and the public realm. It aims to demonstrate the commitment of the civil engineering industry to environmental quality and social performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Ecology and Biodiversity award was all the more notable as initial surveys of the station identified no ecological sensitivities there. The award was largely due to the creation of a 700m<sup>2 </sup>‘living roof’ atop the station’s new Integrated Ticket Hall (ITH).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The installation is ‘brown roof’, a mix of soil and rock atop drainage and base layers. “That’s the difference between a brown and green roof, which is often planted with sedum [flowering plant] species,” explained Costain Environmental Manager, Hannah Rich. “With a brown roof you let whatever is in the area grow naturally, instead of planting particular species.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The aim is to provide a home for invertebrates that, in turn, will provide foraging opportunities for birds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It will also improve the thermal insulation properties of the ITH, help provide gradual drainage of heavy rainfall and contribute some 20% of the London Borough of Islington’s annual Biodiversity Action Plan target for habitat creation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although sustainability measures are often perceived as costly, the brown roof was actually £40,000 less expensive than a comparable zinc roof, despite the need to strengthen the roof structure to accommodate the added weight of soil and rock, said Hannah.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Farringdon was also Highly Commended in the Historic Environment category. Farringdon Station is Grade II listed, which necessitated acquiring special planning consents for work on its Turnmill Street concourse, changes to the ITH façade and works to the London Underground station building.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best practice approach at Farringdon, drawing upon Costain’s earlier experience at railway projects such as St Pancras and King’s Cross, included constructing traditional brick arches, now rarely used in buildings.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>28 March 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has been awarded a front end engineering design (FEED) package by Perenco UK for the replacement of the gas refrigeration plant at its Dimlington Gas Terminal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The terminal uses refrigeration units to chill gas to remove water and hydrocarbon liquids to ensure that the processed gas meets the required specification for the National Gas Transmission System. The units currently use a refrigerant which is due to be phased out by the end of 2014 under EU and UK Law resulting from the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has previously reviewed in collaboration with Perenco UK the technology options to replace the refrigerant and has identified the optimal solution for the Dimlington asset. Perenco UK has now awarded a further contract to develop this approach to a stage which will allow a detailed engineering, procurement and construction contract to be bid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Dimlington Gas Terminal is a strategic national asset that ensures the security of the UK’s gas supply by processing gas from more than 20 offshore fields in the Southern North Sea and has recently been added to PERENCO’s portfolio of UK Assets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bob Price, Perenco UK Project &amp; Developments Manager said: “Perenco UK look forward to continuing the working relationship with Costain after a successful Project Re-Appraisal period. Costain Natural Resources’ positive approach to working closely with Perenco and their capabilities have resulted in a substantial reduction in scope and cost for the Project compared to that produced by the previous Asset Owners. The novel bespoke solution has been a testament to the strengths of both Company’s knowledge and expertise and a desire to produce enhanced Environmental and Business results”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mark Rogerson, Costain’s Natural Resources Division Managing Director, added: “We are delighted to be working with Perenco on this important project and we will work together to deliver a successful and sustainable solution for the refrigeration replacement programme. Our team will bring industry-leading front end engineering experience coupled with full lifecycle capability from recent brownfield projects.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>25 March 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has been awarded a contract to refit two cooling towers at Fiddlers Ferry Power Station near Warrington on behalf of customer, SSE.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The power station has eight natural draught water cooling towers which help to improve the efficiency of the power generation process. However, the silted condition of the plastic heat exchange media inside the cooling towers had resulted in a significant decline in its cooling efficiency and a significant increase in weight imposed on the concrete support beams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the contract, which will be completed during an 18 week period during summer 2013, the site team will dispose of waste material and replace the existing plastic with 13,000m3 of an improved design which will result in less silt contamination. The team will also be installing new plastic spray pipes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The plastic sheets will be fed along assembly lines that have been designed by Costain. A solvent-free adhesive will be mechanically applied to bond together the sheets into modules which will then be dried in racks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the course of the refit work on the water cooling towers, the new PVC modular cooling media will be assembled on site in order to minimise road transport and therefore reduce the carbon footprint associated with transporting equipment to and from the job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Industrial Cooling team has an unparalleled record in the UK market for executing full replacement cooling media refits in coal fired power station hyperbolic natural draught cooling towers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are delighted to have won this contract with SSE. The use of environmentally friendly adhesive will ensure the welfare of on-site personnel and the power station’s owner-operator, SSE. In the past, using alternative solvent-based adhesives required respiratory monitoring, more exacting quality control of the assembled product and inclusion in the station’s emissions schedule,” said Mark Blackham, Costain’s Industrial Cooling Director.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>20 March 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain recently welcomed the second intake of small and medium-sized businesses into its Supply Chain Academy, the Company’s carefully structured learning programme that aims to help train and develop people from all aspects of its supply chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fourteen small and medium-sized businesses attended the second intake to the Academy which was held at its head office in Maidenhead. The companies included AVRS Systems, Millcroft Scaffolding, WW Pipetech Ltd, Franklyn Yates Engineering Limited, Flannery Plant Hire, RJC (UK) Limited, C J Thorne, Max Wright, Richard Alan Group, Westshield, Kelly Formwork, Clipfine Logistics, Wingate Electrical and Bridges Electrical.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After a brief welcome from Alex Vaughan, Costain’s Corporate Development Director, and Head of Supply Chain, Richard Howell, the attendees went straight into a module on Behavioural Safety. Costain’s Peter Brown and Carly White introduced the attendees to the concept of Behavioural Safety and the importance of creating an environment where, through exhibiting leadership, everyone in the Company - from working on-site to working in the office - understands the importance of taking responsibility for their own safety and those around them.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Feedback from this session was very positive. Chris Thorne, Managing Director of C J Thorne, said: “Pete’s no-nonsense approach to behavioural safety, so different to many safety professionals who often put theory before practicality, really improved the learning experience.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Roy Jones, Managing Director of Millcroft Scaffolding, added: “We’ve attended a number of Behavioural Safety seminars over the years but this had an interesting approach to communicating its importance which really raised the bar in terms of communicating awareness.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Academy comprises 20 modules covering a wide range of topics including business administration, commercial and financial best practice, insurance, health &amp; safety, Lean Engineering, behavioural safety and quality. The training is provided at no cost to the suppliers and is in-line with Costain Cares, the Company’s vision to build a longer-term sustainable business that creates economic, environmental and social value.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recruitment for the next intake will commence in May. If you are interested in attending Costain’s Supply Chain Academy then please contact Richard Howell at <a href="mailto:richard.howell@costain.com">richard.howell@costain.com</a>.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>19 March 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work is underway to ensure the security of future water supplies for almost 600,000 people in the East Midlands under a major project for Severn Trent Water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain will supplement, then replace, Europe’s second-largest covered reservoir at Ambergate, north of Derby. The existing reservoir, roughly 190 x 100 metres in size and completed in 1910, is reaching the end of its lifespan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Its 110 million-litre capacity provides water supplies for a large area of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire. It cannot simply be closed while a replacement is constructed, explains Simon Roberts, Costain’s representative on the project board.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We have to build the largest reservoir we can – about 87 million litres – on the space available to us elsewhere on the site. Once we commission this new reservoir, we can take out the old one and build a new one in its footprint for the remainder of the capacity – 50 million litres.” This will give a new total capacity of 137 million litres.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The major technical challenge facing Costain is the local topography; the reservoir site slopes dramatically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This will require Costain to move some 100,000m³ of earth to create a new ‘shoulder’ to the hill. “We pile down to the bedrock, then install a reinforced concrete tank,” says Simon.  A new connection will also have to be created to link it to the Derwent Valley Aquaduct.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That part of the project will be completed first. The existing reservoir will then be decommissioned, demolished down to ground level and the second new reservoir constructed in its place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the project, junction improvements are being made to the nearby A610, so deliveries can more easily be brought to site. However, to minimise HGV movements during the construction process, a concrete batching plant will be constructed on site.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Site clearance is underway, with the earthworks due to start shortly.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">19 March 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain gave its support to National Apprenticeship Week last week, the nationwide initiative that celebrates the positive impact apprenticeships have on individuals, businesses and the UK economy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">National Apprenticeship Week is coordinated by the National Apprenticeship Service with the aim of generating a more highly skilled workforce. Costain has recognised that investing in young people and helping the industry address the long-term skills shortage is crucial for the future success of the UK’s economy, as well as the need to build and maintain the country’s national strategic infrastructure. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of National Apprenticeship Week, which ran from 11-15 March, Costain took part in a number of events to highlight the valuable contribution apprentices make to the economy. According to the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), apprenticeship completions over the next decade could contribute up to £3.4 billion a year to the economy, through productivity gains, by 2022.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The week began when Costain staff, working on the Crossrail C360 contract, attended the Barking and Dagenham College Inspiration Day in East London. The event brought together employers and students for a day of competitions and demonstrations, and allowed students to showcase their skills in plumbing, brickwork, decorating and plastering. The bricklaying competition was sponsored by Costain and judged by Lee Piper from the Reading Station Redevelopment Project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On 13 March, Costain’s Group Technical and Operations Director, Alan Kay, and Tim Embley, the Group’s Innovation and Knowledge Manager, took three Costain apprentices - David Cassar, an apprentice Civil Engineer working on Bond Street; Luc Williams, an apprentice Civil Engineer working at Paddington; and Abad Zalal, a Procurement apprentice working at London Bridge - to the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills in Westminster, London*. The team launched a display to raise awareness about the importance of apprenticeships and to highlight Costain’s commitment to creating real employment opportunities for young people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also last week, two apprentices, Rob Ingram and Chris Appleby, had the opportunity to spend the day with a Divisional Managing Director to gain an insight into how the business works at a senior level and to pick up some career tips from the Company’s leaders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Darren James, MD of Costain’s Infrastructure Division, took Rob under his wing while Mark Rogerson, MD of the Natural Resources Division, looked after Chris.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on his experience, Rob said: “I was offered the opportunity to shadow Darren James for a day and I jumped at the chance. I started the day by meeting him at our new office at Foster Lane before heading to Heathrow for their Quinqennium 6 meeting, a review of Heathrow’s spending plan.  After this, we went to Canary Wharf to meet with Andy Mitchell from Crossrail for the signing of the C644 contract. It was a great experience being able to shadow a Managing Director and to get an insight into his day-to-day activities."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Providing apprentices is an integral part to Costain’s mission of “Engineering Tomorrow,” the Company’s commitment to identifying, developing and implementing innovative solutions in order to meet the national need. Nurturing young talent is a key part of that strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“In order to address the challenge of meeting our national needs, we need professionally trained and highly motivated staff. We are therefore extremely proud to support and recognise our outstanding community of apprentices during National Apprenticeship Week and beyond,” said Mark Rogerson.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Darren James added: “Creating the skilled teams to deliver UK Infrastructure for the 21st Century necessitates the need for apprenticeships now. At Costain, apprentices are a fundamental part of our approach to creating world class teams to deliver innovative solutions for our customers who require us to create, maintain and operate this infrastructure."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has made apprenticeships an operational priority. Now in its third year, the Costain Apprentice Scheme delivers training and employment opportunities to young people seeking a career in the construction and civil engineering industry.<br /> <br />Starting with just six apprentices in 2008, the Company now has 60 young people working in every facet of its business, including building and civil engineering, electrical installation, business administration, laboratory technician, accountancy, instrument design, civil/structural design and piping design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Val Thompstone, Costain’s Apprentice and NVQ Manager, is now organising the Company’s Annual Apprentice Seminar between 3-5 April at the Wyboston Lakes Conference Centre in Bedfordshire. The event gives the apprentices an opportunity to work together to develop their core skills while receiving valuable advice on how to succeed in their chosen careers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain understands the importance of being a responsible business and supporting our customers’ needs through effective management of environmental, social and economic issues to meet our objectives. Providing employment opportunities and effective training programmes for people seeking a career in the construction and civil engineering sector is a key part of that responsibility,” said Val.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain Apprentice Scheme is also a key component of Costain Cares, the Group’s strategy to build a long-term sustainable business that is more responsible - economically, socially and environmentally – to the needs of its stakeholders and the communities in which it works. Costain is an active member of Business in the Community (BITC)  and supports its goal of helping every young person, particularly those facing social disadvantage, to receive support from business to build successful working lives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Catherine Warbrick, Costain’s Corporate Responsibility Director, said: “We are delighted to be associated with National Apprentice Week and Business in the Community. We take great pride in nurturing talent and, in-line with our Costain Cares strategy, our Apprenticeship Scheme gives young people from all backgrounds an excellent opportunity to learn and develop relevant skills for a successful future.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">18 March 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s carbon emission management and performance have improved significantly over the past year, resulting in a higher position in the Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) league table.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group has leapt up the league table for CRC, from 1218th place in 2010-11 to a remarkable 12th place in 2011-12. Almost 2100 companies, councils, government departments and educational establishments were ranked.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The CRC ranking is calculated using three measurements: Early Action Metrics (comprising 40% of the total score); Absolute Metrics (45%); and Growth Metrics (15%).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Early Action Metric rewards organisations who take steps to achieve better management of their carbon emissions, such as achieving a Carbon Standard such as Certified Emissions Measurement And Reduction Scheme (CEMARS) certification.  Absolute Metrics is scored on the reduction in the actual amounts of carbon a company emits in a year. And the Growth Metrics adjust a company’s carbon reduction in relation to growth (or shrinkage) of turnover over a year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There were two main reasons for Costain’s dramatic improvement, said Group Environmental Manager, Amy Shuffleton.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Achieving CEMARS certification in 2012 qualified Costain for a 50% gain in points earned in the Early Action Metrics category.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And the Company scored well in Absolute Metrics (based on 2011-12 data) through a remarkable 65.5% reduction in electricity and fuel used through a combination of actual physical reduction, a shift in the types of work undertaken and project completions. Growth Metrics also saw an almost 50% improvement as the Company grew but emitted proportionately less carbon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amy also congratulated the overall team and, in particular, Graduate  Environmental Adviser, Claire Baker, on their efforts in carbon reduction and management and reiterated the Company's commitment to further enhancing its performance in future years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction companies generally scored well in the CRC rankings. BAM Group and Skanska were first and second respectively, while Carillion was seventh.  In addition to the positive action taken by these companies including Costain, one of the reasons for this is due to the inclusion of bulk fuel in the CRC scheme which can see great variance in use year to year in construction. This has led to reductions across the industry being inflated and criticisms in the accuracy of the league table. However, Costain was still well ahead of other construction sector companies such as Taylor Wimpey (807th place) and Kier Group (832nd).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Government has decided that the CRC league table will be scrapped in future. However, Costain will continue to make its carbon emission figures publically available so that staff and the wider community are aware of its continuing performance in the field.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">14 March 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is involved in a major project in Liverpool’s Docklands as it seeks to ensure that the city’s efficient treatment of waste water continues uninterrupted into the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of a consortium with Galliford Try and Atkins it is now well into a £200 million contract for United Utilities (UU) to upgrade and expand Liverpool Wastewater Treatment Works (WWTW) at Sandon Dock.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The existing WWTW equipment has a limited remaining asset life and is in need of upgrade, says Andy Fielding, Costain’s Construction Manager on the project. Costain, with its partners GallifordTry, Atkins and United Utilities, has undertaken refurbishment work to keep the plant performing, but more substantial measures are required.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These will include replacing many plant items including the current inlet pumps, which lift wastewater from sewer level, with larger, more robust machinery. Other improvement works will extend the existing plant’s usage for a further 15-20 years. The existing site has to remain operational throughout all these works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to ensure process reliability, the WWTW will be extended into the neighbouring Wellington Dock. This dock has been dredged and filled with sand. After sand fill around 1000 concrete piles 20 metres long are being sunk to the bedrock under the dock. The new dock area will be used to build a new SBR (Sequencing Batch Reactor) process tank and will sit as a ‘floating’ construction, atop the capped piles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make maximum use of the available space, the SBR will be double stacked and is fed from a new SBR feed pumping station to high and low level distribution chamber.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the SBR there will be a new sludge treatment facility housed in a single treatment building on the adjacent dockside. The sludge is used to feed the existing MAD plant which generates gas from the sludge as fuel for a CHP unit which can generate 1-2MW of electricity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction work is currently 20% complete and forecasting a completion award of the PIU (plant in use) of August 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team will peak at 100 staff and approximately 250 operatives. The project team recently celebrated 500,000 man hours without RIDDOR.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Darren Dobson, the GCA lead for Liverpool WWTW remarked: “This large complex project is being delivered in partnership with our client UU.

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">13 March 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has played a major role in creating the first nationally-accredited environmental training programme for construction site workers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company, together with Skanska and Wates Group plus support from CITB-Construction Skills, has been instrumental in setting up the Site Environmental Awareness Course (SEATS), which is endorsed by both the UK Contractors Group (UKCG) and the Environment Agency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The one-day SEATS course provides site personnel with the knowledge to handle typical environmental issues they are likely to encounter,  such as water and waste management, land contamination and hazard awareness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Group SHE Director, Peter Fisher, launched SEATS to the industry and press on 28 February; he was instrumental in promoting the need for such a course to the National Construction College SHE Committee and the UKCG around two years ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain also undertook an industry questionnaire in June 2011, seeking to understand the industry’s environmental training needs and wants, then worked with CITB-Construction Skills and the other partners to develop the programme, a business case and find the necessary funding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is a registered training provider for SEATS and, together with Skanska and Wates, intends to roll-out SEATS as a mandatory requirement for all site supervisors and managers. It has already run two courses as part of Costain’s supply chain academy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new course is “an important step in raising the benchmark for environmental best practice across the wider industry,” commented Andy Walder, director of the National Construction College. “We have a responsibility to help employers manage the impact their activities have on the wider environment – equipping the industry with the skills and training it needs to deliver long-term beneficial change.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Head of Policy at the UKCG, Simon Nathan, added that the new course “will provide a common benchmark for those working on site and will be a recognised programme that can be utilised by firms large and small”.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">11 March 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain and its partners have reached a significant milestone in National Grid’s project to ensure security of supply for London’s future electricity demands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project involves driving some 32km of tunnels to form what client National Grid describes as an ‘electricity superhighway’ underneath the capital, allowing it to lay new high-voltage cables.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of this London Power Tunnels contract, tunnel boring machine (TBM) Evelyn broke through into a pre-prepared shaft at St John’s Wood, northwest London, following a year-long 7.26km drive from Willesden, west London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The tunnelling “output was reliable. We built on an efficient launch and maintained good progress. The best single shift advance was greater than 50m in 12 hours” said Costain’s Project Manager, Andrew Firth. “The machine performed very well.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Evelyn will now be lifted out of the St John’s Wood shaft and transported by road to Wandsworth, south London, from which it will begin driving a 3.5km tunnel towards Wimbledon, in the capital’s southwest suburbs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once that is completed in around six months, the TBM will again be transported by road, this time back to Wandsworth, from where it will set out on its final, 9km drive to Kensal Green.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The remaining 13km of the route, meanwhile, is being handled by a second TBM, Cleopatra, which is tunnelling from South Tottenham, north London, to St John’s Wood. The TBMs’ crews are a mix of personnel from Costain and its tunnelling partners, VVB and Joseph Gallagher.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The February breakthrough at St John’s Wood was hailed by National Grid’s Head of Cable Tunnels, David Luetchford, as “a dramatic illustration of how National Grid plays its part in connecting people to the energy they use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s nice to think that as Londoners go about their business, Evelyn, Cleopatra and our engineers are at work deep underground, helping to make sure that the capital’s future energy needs are met.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">5 March 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Nuclear Process has secured another work package with Magnox Ltd, its second contract in a strategic framework to deliver to construction, infrastructure and maintenance work across 10 nuclear decommissioning sites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Safestores Strengthening Project involves reinforcing the upper structure of the Safestores, or reactor buildings, at Trawsfynydd Power Station in order to make them safe before they’re reduced in height at a later date. The power station stopped generating power in 1991 and all fuel has been removed from the twin reactors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is worth around £2.7 million and includes improving the integrity of the structures with specially designed steel sections attached to the internal surfaces of the safestores buildings. At a total height of almost 170 feet, the job includes the careful design and provision of scaffolding and access platforms, putting in place intricate lifting plans and all executed with due consideration to the possible existence of asbestos.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work started on the mobilisation phase of the project on January 3, with construction due to begin in early March.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Safety is paramount on this project. Not only are we working at a considerable height, but we also need to improve the integrity of the structure by pinning steel bars to the inside of the walls and bracing the concrete structure. The building has been partially eroded by the elements and we have to ensure that the strengthening project provides the integrity the building needs to get them safely through to the next phase of decommissioning,” said Chris Scott, Costain’s Operations Director for Nuclear Process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain was awarded a place on the £288 million Infrastructure, Construction and Enablers (ICE) Framework contract with Magnox Ltd. in September 2012 for the delivery of construction, infrastructure and maintenance projects on behalf of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority which owns the 10 nuclear sites managed by Magnox.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>4 March 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is pursuing new methods of road usage analysis to help get the maximum capacity out of the UK’s highways network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) and Sheffield University Computer Science Department are undertaking groundbreaking research with Costain to give greater accuracy in predicting breakdowns of traffic flows. This is intended to give insights into how the greatest traffic volumes can be achieved on the road network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’ve formed an industry group including ourselves, TRL, Sheffield University and others to exploit emerging microsimulation analysis technologies,” explained Technical Director, Bill Hewlett.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Current Government priorities are firstly to optimise the performance of existing roads; secondly to remove pinch points on the road network; and thirdly to build major new highway schemes. Virtually the only major new transport scheme being talked about at the moment is the HS2 high-speed rail link; nobody is talking about roads at this level of investment.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Understanding how to make the best possible use of existing roads is therefore increasingly important.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“If we can make more economical or effective use of existing roads, we can bring economic benefits to the UK. This is in line with our strategy of being a solutions provider.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One way of doing this is by implementing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) techniques. ITS is defined as the integration of information and communications technology with transport infrastructure. It can take many forms, at its simplest ranging from warning drivers of hazards ahead, to highly sophisticated systems which plan routes in response to traffic density and take over control of the vehicle. Costain is already active in this field with its patented DRUM (Dynamic Roadspace Utilisation Manager) tool which improves traffic flows through motorway schemes and accelerates construction programmes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two TRL reports prepared for Costain on traffic flows review the state-of-the-art in ITS and in microsimulation techniques with the aim of understanding how they can be enhanced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Microsimulation tools model individual vehicles to determine factors such as their speed, acceleration and lane changing, which on aggregate indicate the speed and flow on the highway. An accurate microsimulation model is vital for predicting how a new road scheme or technology will perform, and could be used for predicting and dispersing congestion in real time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The reports recommend that significant improvements can be made to most microsimulation modelling through enhanced calibration using CCTV and other highways data, and they point to the technologies that Sheffield have developed which handle parallel processing at orders of magnitude faster than real time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Out on the highway you can’t just try things and hope they work,” observes Bill.  “You have to know that your proposals are safe and that your investment will pay back.” Dense traffic moving at high speed has lots of dangers, so prediction is vital. “This is where our new methods come in. New solutions in ITS are radical innovations and have no track record; often their impact defies conventional analysis. My positioning for Costain is so that we can take advantage of new techniques of analysis as they emerge so we’re the first in the field,” said Bill. “That is certainly of interest to clients.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>26 February 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has secured two engineering and procurement services projects at Total’s Lindsey Oil Refinery, which will further improve the environmental performance of the refinery located at Immingham on the Humber Estuary in Lincolnshire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first project will allow the installation of a flare gas recovery compressor on the refinery flare system. Recovering and using the gas rather than burning it to atmosphere will reduce atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulphur oxides (SOx). It will also reduce the requirement to import natural gas as a fuel. The new installation is planned to come online in late 2014. The project will also allow further flare gas recovery systems to be accommodated in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second project is to install a Freon replacement package on one of the refinery’s cryogenic units, in line with requirements for meeting the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, which comes into effect at the end of 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new refrigeration package, which will use propane as a refrigerant rather than Freon, will be designed so that it can be manufactured off site in a modular format and installed with minimal disruption to production on site. The new installation is planned to come online following the shutdown scheduled for September 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has used modular technology on a number of projects with great success in both the oil &amp; gas and nuclear industries. Modularisation is highly suited for working in constrained workspaces on complex sites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The combined contracts  will be executed by Costain’s Teeside team located in Stockton-on-Tees with support from its Manchester office.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the project awards, Frank Millar, Costain’s Hydrocarbons &amp; Chemicals Sector Director, said: “We are delighted to be working with Total on these projects, which demonstrate the progress made by the Company’s Teesside operation since it opened in 2009, and build on the work Costain is currently executing at Lindsey Oil Refinery from its Immingham-based Industrial Services and Civil Engineering business.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Claire Hall, 24, who has recently joined Costain as a receptionist, has been chosen to be part of the Women’s National Rugby League team to represent England in the World Cup.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Claire, who works at the Costain Evaporator D project at Sellafield, has been playing rugby league since the tender age of eight.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Claire made her England debut when she was just 18 and has nine England caps to date. She was part of the 2008 World Cup in Australia. Claire has also been part of two successful tours to France – winning all the games played.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“In the 16 years that I’ve been playing rugby I’ve never had any bad injuries - touch wood. But I’ve suffered my fair share of cuts and bruises including a black eye on my first day working for Costain!” says Claire. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Neil Grosset, Project Manager, said: “The Evaporator D team is very proud of Claire's achievements. Her dedication and commitment is clearly evident in her approach to working on Evaporator D and is an inspiration to the whole team as they are greeted daily on reception, especially when a black eye is present.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To get selected for England, scouts from the Rugby Football League (RFL) travel the length and breadth of the Country looking for the best talent. Claire is currently undergoing a rigorous training programme in preparation for the games which start in early July.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>25 February 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is undertaking trials of a new cloud-based application enterprise system that is hoped to bring efficiency benefits to both the Company and its customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">MobiCloud is a European Union-funded project to develop a European ‘corporate appstore’ as part of the EU’s Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, in collaboration with Appear (Sweden), EsperantoXL (Netherlands), Nettropolis (Germany) and COMIT Projects (UK).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The MobiCloud infrastructure consists of a context-aware app container deployed in a smartphone or tablet connecting to Costain’s corporate systems via a cloud-hosted platform.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“MobiCloud represents an exciting opportunity for Costain to be at the cutting edge of mobile communication technology,” says Civil Engineer James Bulleid, who is heading the mobilisation team for a Welsh contract that will utilise the new system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This innovative system will combine back-end systems to present workers with vital information in the field. We have an enthusiastic team, who will be using this project as an opportunity to invent new solutions and push the boundaries of mobile applications. This will further increase efficiency and improve safety, both of which are key components of Costain’s end-to-end solutions.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Civil Engineer Matt Procter, who is supporting the project:  “It will streamline work processes for Costain, optimising the end-service offered to customers.  There are a range of applications and benefits. For example, an app within the system offers configurable electronic documentation that can be deployed to devices in the field. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Any site paperwork, such as risk assessments, method statements and safety briefings can be brought to life on site via a tablet interface and linked to Costain’s back-end systems. The beauty of this solution is that it can all be done in a live context. The vision is that Costain can make more business practices electronic.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Group Innovation and Knowledge Manager, Tim Embley, sees further advantages: “It will allow us to deploy our workforce more efficiently across customers’ assets and collect data in real time. We will be able to achieve more with less.  This project demonstrates how Costain is investing in the latest technology and innovation in collaboration with the customer to bring commercial value to contracts and improve frontline services.” </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">MobiCloud is also an online technology marketplace where end-users, mobile developers, app vendors, system integrators and cloud service providers can collaborate to develop solutions for the construction industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Subcontractors and customers of Costain are encouraged to join the MobiCloud early adopter program by contacting <a href="mailto:info@mobicloudproject.eu">info@mobicloudproject.eu</a> </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">21 February 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team behind the project to ensure Cleaner Seas for Sussex is now on the final straight as the Peacehaven Wastewater Treatment Works (WWTW) nears completion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Only minor works remain to be undertaken on the £300million project to improve the last area in the UK that failed to meet the EU water treatment directive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Completion means that the wastewater produced by residents of Peacehaven, Telscombe, Saltdean, Rottingdean and Brighton and Hove is now being treated to the highest standards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project, which has involved drilling 11km of tunnels and laying a 2.5km sea outfall pipe as well as moving over one million m³ of earth at Peacehaven alone, is about to undergo its final test.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’re getting ready for 28-day compliance testing,” says Senior Project Manager, Graham Sugrue. “We put the plant into automatic operation and let it run itself.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among the challenges that Graham’s team – which numbered around 400 at its peak – had to meet was compliance with 66 planning conditions, delivering 30,000m³ of concrete through one small access road and allaying the concerns of a local community over the new WWTW.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All those challenges have been overcome. Additionally, the project has achieved 2.5 million RIDDOR-free hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both Southern Water and the local councils involved are happy, adds Graham, for whom the project has occupied his life for the past four years. “I recall standing in the middle of the site in June 2009 with a couple of my guys, saying ‘In three years’ time we’ll have installed 2,000 tonnes of steel, poured 30,000 tonnes of concrete and moved a million cubic metres of material here.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“If I look back at that and look at the time-lapse photography on how the site has progressed I get an immense sense of achievement and pride.  It’s been a good project to be part of.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>20 February 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two infrastructure projects that Costain is heavily involved in have won prestigious international tunnelling awards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Organised by New Civil Engineer magazine and the International Tunnelling Association, the winners of the 2012 NCE International Tunnelling Awards were announced at the Sheraton Centre Toronto Hotel to an audience which included some of the biggest names in the industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first award, for Safety Initiative of the Year, was for Costain’s work on the London Power Tunnels on behalf of National Grid, together with Halcrow, Mott Macdonald, Skanska, VVB and National Grid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The London Power Tunnels scheme is a major engineering project to rewire the capital in order to meet the capital’s increasing demand for electricity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mike Napier, Costain’s Strategy and Business Development Director for Infrastructure, said the project strived to place safety at the forefront of its operations by challenging and improving accepted tunnelling practices. In short, no risk activities were undertaken without careful planning and a strict adherence to site rules which created a culture of “we will work safely or not at all,” said Mike.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project has achieved over one million RIDDOR free man-hours, with just two lost-time injuries reported. The team implemented a health and safety strategy that aimed to perform beyond legislative requirements in order to achieve zero work site injuries. The project team also established an ethos that all injuries could be prevented if staff were empowered to make changes themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Elsewhere, Costain, along with Laing O'Rourke, Halcrow-Atkins and Senceive, won the Product / Equipment Innovation of the Year Award for developing the Senceive Tunnel Monitoring System on the £300 million Bond Street Station Upgrade for London Underground. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Senceive is a safe, reliable system that monitored the tunnel lining while grouting took place. The monitoring system used Senceive’s high resolution wireless tilt meters mounted on tunnel lining segments, showing their individual rotational and linear equivalent movements on Senceive’s Webmonitor software. The innovative magnetic sensor fixings, designed by Halcrow and Senceive, allowed fast and simple deployment as well as relocation during shifts, and the design ensured that sensors could also be left in situ during running hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“There were many challenges on this project and monitoring the tunnel during grouting was the biggest. The Senceive system gave us the flexibility to move the grouting location on a nightly basis and the confidence that the tunnel movement was within the agreed trigger levels during grouting,” said James Brookfield, a Costain engineer on the Bond Street project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tim Embley, Costain’s Group Innovation and Knowledge Manager, added: “Remote monitoring is an important service we are providing to our customers and we are pleased to be able to support Senceive in this innovation. It reduces costs compared to traditional methods and allows our teams to remotely monitor assets safely during construction and through the life of the asset.  Remote monitoring is all about providing intelligent solutions to our customers to enhance their business performance and reduce the cost of infrastructure delivery.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">19 February 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The link between Costain Cares and The Prince’s Trust charity has been strengthened through a group of graduate engineers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A five-strong team took part in the aptly-named Grim Challenge, an annual 8.5-mile charity race over an army assault course at Aldershot in the dead of winter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having decided to participate, the team – Oliver Teall, Chris Crabtree, Adam Flory, Tom Cleary and Anna Davies – consulted Costain’s Corporate Responsibility Director, Catherine Warbrick, for an appropriate good cause to which it could contribute.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Catherine suggested the Prince’s Trust, of which Costain has been a patron since mid-2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain supports the Trust in its goals of helping tens of thousands of young people get their lives back under control, as well as shaping training opportunities around the skills shortages and job opportunities across the construction industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Trust exists to assist young people aged 14-30 who face real adversity by helping them to realise their potential.  It focuses their efforts on supporting youngsters who have struggled at school, been in the care system, are long-term unemployed or have had brushes with the law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Cares is the Company’s major initiative to build a longer-term, sustainable business that creates greater economic, environmental and social value.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We had a sit-down meeting with the Trust,” said Tom. “They were happy to have us support them and provided us with branded t-shirts to wear on the day.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Conditions were so bad for the race that the start had to be delayed for 45 minutes to allow organisers to break ice on the flooded areas through which the 3,000 participants had to run. The Costain participants braved the conditions to win more than £600 in sponsorship for the Trust.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">14 February 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain team working on contracts at London’s main airport has won recognition for its commitment to health and safety with two awards at the first Heathrow Development Safety Awards ceremony.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Its efforts were rewarded with the team taking top slot in ‘Health – Campaigns/Initiatives’, while it also picked up a Highly Commended ranking in the ‘Approach to Behavioural Safety’ category.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It won the Health category by putting together a SHE calendar entitled ‘Costain Cares Month’ for November 2012. This focused on a series of topics, including abrasive wheels, winter working and cancer awareness. The last of these saw a nurse from MacMillan Cancer Support visiting the site and holding one-to-one sessions with both on-site staff and office workers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The judges applauded Costain for what they described as a number of good health initiatives throughout the month that had been aimed at making its workforce aware of health and wellbeing issues, together with the potential effects of their working environment and lifestyle choices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They also commended the Company’s “very high quality” submission in the behavioural safety category, the training for which set out to identify in simple, straightforward terms how personnel were encouraged to ‘do the right thing’ when it came to safety because they wanted to, not because they had to.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Awards represent a good year of hard work in development,” said Costain’s Operations Director, Joe Kemm. “We were very pleased – overjoyed, in fact – to get this recognition marking our commitment to Safety, Health and Environment on Heathrow’s Projects and Solutions.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Awards are destined to become an annual event.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>13 February 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Manager, James Bulleid has capped a remarkable year by winning the New Engineering Foundation (NEF) Innovator of the Year Award.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Innovation Awards were presented at the NEF’s annual ‘Innovisions’ conference at the Institute of Directors in London. They were established last year to recognise and celebrate the best in UK innovation. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Winners of the eight categories were decided by a panel of industry experts, opinion-formers and leaders including the award sponsors EMC, BASF and National Grid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The winners were chosen due to their clarity of intended purpose, uniqueness of approach, potential impact, and whether they stimulated and galvanised others,” said Professor Sa’ad Medhat, CEO of the NEF.  “The winners will contribute to a culture of innovation which will help promote sustainable growth in the UK.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">James joined Costain as a Graduate Engineer. The main factor behind his accolade was recognition of an overall mindset towards innovation and technology-led solutions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The NEF was interested in how I transferred a series of technical solutions into a construction environment, bringing together two industries that don’t often merge,” he commented.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He was put forward for the award by Group Innovation Manager, Tim Embley. It was the latest in a series of prizes in 2012, including Trainee of the Year at the Company’s Achieving Excellence Awards, one of the Sir Albert Costain Memorial Awards, as well as Construction News’s Rising Star of the Year Award.  He also achieved Chartered status in civil engineering.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He is currently Mobilisation Manager for a highway technology maintenance contract. His role also includes strategy and business development for Costain’s Highways sector.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>12 February 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain joint venture team (4Delivery) behind Southern Water’s Cleaner Seas for Sussex Peacehaven Wastewater Treatment Works has achieved a remarkable performance in the Considerate Constructors Scheme (CCS).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A monitor’s report in late January gave the site, which is hugely improving the quality of wastewater treatment from the Brighton and Hove catchment area, a rating of 47 out of 50.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Three of the categories measured – ‘Enhancing the site’s appearance’, ‘Protecting the environment’ and ‘Securing everyone’s safety’ – were marked as 9/10, or ‘exceptional’, while ‘Respecting the community’ and ‘Caring for the workforce’ scored a full 10.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This latter score is only awarded where performance is deemed ‘Innovative’ and setting new standards that can be incorporated into the CCS for future projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the case of ‘Respecting the community’, that has entailed huge efforts over the years to keep  local residents on-side for what had been regarded for many years before construction got underway as a controversial project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There have been 2,000 site visitors over the construction phase and two educational videos have been made for local residents, one showing the progress of wastewater from the time someone flushes their toilet to the moment when the treated wastewater is released to sea, the other explaining the tunnelling required to construct the long sea outfall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team’s achievement is all the more impressive given changes in the CCS scoring system, which makes gaining a high mark even more challenging, said Senior Project Manager, Graham Sugrue. “It’s a lot more difficult now. It’s based on innovation and going the extra mile; it’s about doing more than the norm.  Everyone has put in a huge effort; the CCS score reflects this.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is nearing completion, with commissioning well underway.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">11 February 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is showcasing its range of vocational opportunities for graduates and apprentices at the upcoming Heathrow Jobs &amp; Careers Fair.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event, which is scheduled to take place on February 12 at the Renaissance London Heathrow Hotel from 9.30am to 7pm, is free to enter and aims to encourage the 320 companies that work at London’s Heathrow Airport to recruit local people from the Ealing, Hillingdon, Hounslow, Slough and Spelthorne area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fair gives visitors, whether they’re students, teachers or parents, an opportunity to meet prospective employers and to get a better understanding about the range of opportunities available for school leavers and graduates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The airport employs a large and diverse workforce in areas such as airline staff, security personnel, ground crew, fire and police officers, engineers, construction workers, caterers and retail staff, and all of the companies that work at Heathrow in these sectors will be represented at the event.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has worked on a number of projects at Heathrow, which is one of the world’s busiest international airports with over 190,000 passengers a day across five terminals, including the repair and maintenance of existing infrastructure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Heathrow Jobs &amp; Careers Fair gives employers like Costain a fantastic opportunity to inform prospective apprentices and graduate trainees what skills, qualifications and characteristics we are looking for so they can make an informed decision about what career path to take and how Costain can help them,” said Joe Kemm, Costain’s Operations Director Airports.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Investing in young people and helping the industry address a long-term skills shortage is an integral component of Costain Cares, the Group’s strategy to build a long-term sustainable business. Now in its third year, the Costain Apprentice Scheme delivers training and employment opportunities to young people seeking a career in the construction and civil engineering industry and in fields ranging from engineering construction to business administration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Donna Rose will be hosting Costain’s stand and giving prospective candidates the information they need about a career within the Group.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain offers a wealth of opportunity for school leavers and graduates looking for a career in the construction and engineering industry. We’ll be giving advice about career progression and, if they’re interested, what the next steps are,” said Donna.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">8 February 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain celebrated last night the achievements and outstanding performance of its people from across the Group at its Achieving Excellence Awards 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Held at Norden Farm Centre for the Arts in Maidenhead, the event was hosted by Jonathan Stebbings from Olivier Mythodrama, a company which specialises in using the works of Shakespeare to highlight the qualities of leadership. Attendees heard how, through exceptional performance, Costain’s employees galvanised those around them and enhanced the Company’s reputation for operational excellence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This year, a special award, Costain’s Brand Award, was given to the Bond Street Team (Crossrail) C411 for its work in enhancing the Costain brand while working on Europe’s biggest rail infrastructure project. This complex project also happens to be in the heart of the UK’s busiest shopping district and the team was applauded for its community engagement, dedication and high level of customer service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chief Executive, Andrew Wyllie, said: “We are delighted to be recognising the outstanding performances of individuals and teams with these Costain Achieving Excellence Awards 2012. We are Meeting National Needs by engineering excellence in every facet of our operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"These Awards graphically illustrate that we achieve just that. In total, we received 1,300 nominations from Costain people, highlighting the efforts and achievements of skilled individuals at all levels in the Company. In terms of innovation, our people have developed new ways of operating which have saved time, increased profit and improved performance.  In the area of safety, our efforts continue to reduce accidents and ensure that people go home from work safe and sound. Other categories showcase similar successes. This Company is extremely proud of its people and these Awards demonstrate why. Costain would not exist without its people and would not be such a respected brand without the type of outstanding performance which we now have a chance to applaud.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">6 February 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain team working on the Dwr Cymru Welsh Water (DCWW) Framework is celebrating after exceeding six years without a RIDDOR (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations). This remarkable milestone was reached on January 31 2013. The team boasts an Accident Frequency Rate of zero and has seen over 2.6 million manhours worked without a RIDDOR during this six year period.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Madden, Framework Director, said: "It is a remarkable achievement to attain six years without a reportable accident. The Framework has an impressive safety record and the staff and supply chain continue to demonstrate an outstanding commitment to health and safety.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He added: “The team works hard to promote numerous Health and Safety initiatives and continues to drive the CBS programme across all of the Framework projects."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Framework intends to appropriately mark this milestone with all the Costain Framework staff and supply chain who have contributed to this superb safety achievement.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">4 February 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has welcomed the next generation of engineers and quantity surveyors into its professional ranks after they achieved professional status in their chosen careers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A total of 13 people achieved professional status in 2012 in the Company’s three core areas: civil engineering, mechanical engineering and surveying. Costain’s James Bulleid, Peter Ogden and Phil Davis (CEng) received their Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) Chartership in autumn 2012, following the success of Beth Willoughby, Ivan Vukomanovic, Lauren Blakely and Mark Jenkins (CEng) who received their Chartership in spring 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Elsewhere, Alex Holloway (CEng) and Chris Hodgson (CEng) received their Chartership from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE) in November 2012 and December 2012 respectively, while Jonathan Curtin, Victoria Leyshon, Nav Patel and Stuart Slade received their Charterships and professional status from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gaining professional or chartered status demonstrates a person’s commitment to their chosen profession and shows that an individual possesses a high level of knowledge in their field of work, as judged by a peer group of similar professionals. Gaining recognition is characterised by a person’s ability to develop appropriate solutions to problems using new and existing technologies. It also shows that the individual and their employer are committed to excellence and are able to demonstrate this as the benchmark of the Company’s services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lee Bateson, a M&amp;E Manager at Costain Engineering Services, coordinates training in mechanical engineering, instrumentation, controls and automation (MEICA) and believes the Company’s MEICA capability is essential to its ability to deliver projects across its chosen sectors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Alex and Chris are leading the way and I hope to see many more Mechanical and Electrical graduates and engineers applying for and becoming registered Chartered Engineers over the next few years. With our training, development and mentoring process we will soon have many more of our engineers from all disciplines becoming chartered. I would also like to say a big thank you to all of our mentors for providing guidance and advice,” said Lee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pete Tosland, a Commercial Manager at Costain, coordinates and manages the Company’s training for RICS. He believes gaining professional status has never been more important, particularly in helping to meet the demands of customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Employees obtaining professional status help us to meet our customer’s needs whilst giving excellent opportunities to our employee. In addition to this benefit, the process required to obtain Chartership ensures that the employee is bettering themselves with continuous improvement in all areas of their work,” said Pete.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bill Hewlett, Costain’s Group Technical Director, added: “Professionalism is at the heart of Costain’s offering to our customers and I am delighted to see the next generation developing their skills and knowledge by securing some of the toughest qualifications around.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">31 January 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“A fantastic spectacle” was how Infrastructure Managing Director, Darren James, described the running of a steam train through London Underground tunnels – the start of a year-long Costain involvement with London Transport Museum as the capital’s Underground system celebrates its 150th anniversary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Chairman, David Allvey, Group Commercial Director, Patrick Bruce, Rail Director, Gren Edwards, and Darren were among invited guests on the steam locomotive-hauled special train from Kensington Olympia along the Hammersmith &amp; City Line to Moorgate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The trip replicated the early years of the Tube, when passengers had to cope with the smoke and cinders thrown out by the early locomotives in the tunnels under London’s streets. Thousands turned out to see the event.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain team then moved to one of London Underground’s (LU) newest trains for the short trip to St Pancras Station to meet London Mayor Boris Johnson, LU Managing Director, Mike Brown, and other senior LU and rail industry personnel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is one of the industry sponsors of events to be staged at or by London Transport Museum during the 150th anniversary. “Given the growth of the rail sector in Costain and the ongoing momentum, we felt it was appropriate we participated in one of the rail industry’s most important celebrations,” said Darren.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“London Transport Museum is one of the best, industry-recognised focal points for not only transport in London but the rail infrastructure generally – where we are arguably the biggest deliverer.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is involved in the major upgrade and expansion of Bond Street Tube station and is in the process of handing Farringdon Station back to LU after a major reconstruction project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is also involved at London Bridge and Paddington Stations for Network Rail and Crossrail respectively; both are important Tube stations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In a joint venture with Vinci, it is also tendering for a major upgrade of Bank Station, one of the busiest on the network. The project will include a new southbound Northern Line tunnel enabling the platform to be widened, reducing crowding, plus a new Northern Line concourse with additional passageways and escalators to the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) and Central Line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the decades LU investment and Costain involvement has produced a major contribution to the capital’s infrastructure. Projects like Bank demonstrate the Company’s determination to continue that link.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">30 January 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Highways Agency’s managed motorway scheme between Junctions 10-13 of the M1 in Bedfordshire is now fully operational nearly four months ahead of schedule.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain-Carillion JV, the lead contractor, reached the milestone after key system and technology tests were completed just ahead of the busy Christmas getaway period.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first section of the scheme, which aims to relieve congestion by using technology to vary the speed limit, went live between Junctions 10 and 11 in July 2012. From its East Regional Control Centre at South Mimms, Agency staff can display overhead electronic signals to show variable mandatory speed limits and overhead message signs to indicate when drivers can use the hard shoulder as an extra lane. By using the hard shoulder as an additional lane at busy times the scheme is able to increase road capacity without the need to acquire additional land.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contract was awarded to Costain-Carillion JV in September 2005 as an Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) Scheme and work commenced in December 2009. While the scheme is fully operational, further work is required and will be completed at night when traffic levels are lower.  Work is due to be completed by spring 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lynne Stinson, the Highways Agency Project Manager, said: “Work on the M1 Junctions 10 to 13 managed motorways scheme has progressed well. We were able to start testing on the remaining sections of the project some four months earlier than originally planned. This meant road users were able to benefit from the extra lane capacity in time for the Christmas and New Year holiday, with variable speed limits helping to improve traffic flow.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paul McWilliam, the Highways Agency’s East Region Operations Manager, said: “Our Regional Control Centre had been using the system on the southern section between Junction 10-11 since July last year but now our control centre staff and the Agency’s on-road traffic officers based at Toddington will be able to manage the full length of the scheme.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bruce Richards, the Project Director for the M1 J10-13 Improvement Scheme, added: “This is a fantastic achievement for everyone working on the project. Managed motorway schemes are an innovative and cost effective way to ensure the continual flow of traffic during the busiest times of the day and we are delighted to have reached this significant milestone ahead of schedule.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">28 January 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Annual Apprentice Seminar gives apprentices valuable advice on how to succeed in their chosen careers and a clear understanding about why they are so important to the future success of the business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Scheduled to take place between April 3-5 at Wyboston Lakes Conference Centre in Bedfordshire, apprentices from across the business will have the opportunity, through group team building activities and workshops, to develop their core skills. These include listening and questioning skills, negotiating and assertiveness training and learning the importance of community relations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Investing in young people and helping the industry address the long-term skills shortage is an integral component of Costain Cares, the Group’s strategy to build a long-term sustainable business that is more responsive - economically, socially and environmentally - to the needs of its stakeholders and the communities in which it works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain recognises the importance of being a responsible business, supporting our customers’ needs through effective management of environmental, social and economic issues to meet our objectives. That includes giving opportunities to young people through supporting training programmes, both on and off site,” said Val Thompstone, Costain’s Apprentice and NVQ Manager.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Apprentice Seminar is a fantastic opportunity for our apprentices to develop their core skills. The emphasis is on personal development through team building and gaining a better understanding about why these core skills are so important to the wider business,” said Val.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now in its third year, the Costain Apprentice Scheme delivers excellent training and employment opportunities to young people seeking a career in the construction and civil engineering industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Scheme was set up to address the need for succession planning in vital roles and ensure the next generation of qualified employees, other than those on the Graduate Trainee Scheme, could still enter the business. Costain currently has apprenticeships in a number of industry critical disciplines, including building and civil engineering, electrical installation, business administration, laboratory technician, accountancy, instrument design, civil/structural design and piping design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All those on an apprenticeship are encouraged to gain technical professional membership of the relevant Institution while being mentored and supported along the way. The apprenticeships are provided by a variety of Agencies, but all include a technical certificate and an NVQ at Level 3 as a minimum, and each varies in length from between two and four years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are some examples of what recent apprentices have had to say about Costain’s Apprentice Scheme:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chris Biggin, Apprentice Electrician at Costain Energy &amp; Process, said: </strong>“As an apprentice, I never feel alone. Costain people fully support the apprenticeship scheme and always ensure your best interests are considered. I am surrounded by people who try to push my career forward and help in any way they can.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Jynul Ahmed, Apprentice Engineer, Crossrail, said:</strong> "To know that I’m playing a part in the construction of an enormous project such as Crossrail is an amazing feeling. Costain does its best to keep the apprentices and new starters in the loop, and I love the fact that my work is recognised and appreciated no matter how big or how small. Working as a Civil Engineer has been a dream of mine since childhood, and it's thanks to Costain that this dream is now becoming a reality."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Craig Steven – Electrical Maintenance Apprentice – Oil and Pipeline Agency, said: </strong>“I have had the opportunity to take part on a lot of different projects within the Costain set-up and I have gained a lot of valuable experience in my chosen field. My day ranges from learning electrical maintenance from my mentor to helping pump essential fuels to military airbases around our area. I attend college every Friday. Costain has welcomed me with open arms and I really feel like I’m on the road to success.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you’re interested in attending the seminar or know someone who may be interested in a Costain Apprenticeship, then please contact Val Thompstone at <a href="mailto:val.thompstone@costain.com">val.thompstone@costain.com</a></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">23 January 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A-one+*, a Costain joint venture, has announced the achievement of a major safety landmark on the Highways Agency’s Area 12 which covers the strategic roads network across Yorkshire, Humberside and North Lincolnshire. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently, Area 12 reached the significant milestone of one million hours worked without a reportable lost time incident, an accolade that few in our industry can claim and is a first for Area 12. At the time of writing the figure is now 1.4 million hours. <br /> <br />Brian Statham, General Manager for A-one+ in Area 12, said: "This is a significant milestone that few in our industry can claim and is a first for Area 12.  This is a remarkable achievement for a Highways Agency managing agent contract (MAC) when put into perspective - a 'site' over 1,200km long, the majority of works at night and adjacent to live high speed traffic, hundreds of individual schemes and thousands of people involved over the period including our own staff and workers such as sub contractors in our supply chain."<br /> <br />The Area 12 MAC team has been congratulated by Roger Wantling, Service Delivery Team Leader for the Highways Agency.<br /> <br />Mr Wantling said: "The health and safety of everyone who works and travels on our network within Area 12 is of the highest importance. To hear that we have achieved one million hours worked without a RIDDOR in October 2012 after eight months without a single reportable accident is tremendous news. I am also aware that such a landmark could not have been achieved without the dedication to health and safety from everyone involved. <br /> <br />"In particular, I would like to praise our colleagues on the frontline, who often have to work in difficult and potentially dangerous conditions out on the network to make it as safe and operational as possible for our customers. Without their commitment such a landmark could certainly not have been achieved.   This is certainly a significant achievement for Area 12 and long may it continue."<br /> <br />A-one+ is celebrating the landmark by presenting to the staff specially commissioned soft shell jackets with an appropriate logo detailing the achievement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A-one+ has also recently been highly commended at the recent Prince Michael International Road Safety Awards in London.  The international panel of judges commented that the company's road safety initiatives including a Road Worker Safety Radio Campaign which has run across Yorkshire and the North East and other initiatives “showed sound, simple thinking with a systematic approach” that made an “outstanding contribution to improving road safety.”<br /> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*A-one+ is a joint venture between civil engineering firms Halcrow, Colas and Costain providing integrated highways services.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">22 January 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain-Carillion Joint Venture (JV) has won two awards at the Highways Agency’s Supplier Recognition Scheme, which recognises suppliers who demonstrate class-leading performance in driving down costs and delivering increasingly efficient and effective customer services, and promoting best practice in the Agency’s supply chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now in its second year, the annual recognition programme highlights the important contribution made by the Agency’s suppliers, who play a vital role in supporting the Agency in operating, maintaining and improving the strategic road network in England.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The awards ceremony took place in Birmingham and was attended by the Agency’s supply chain network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain-Carillion JV is working on a new managed motorway scheme which uses variable speed limits to help manage the flow of traffic and the hard shoulder to give extra capacity when traffic levels increase. The scheme went live between Junctions 10 and 11 in July 2012 and is due to be completed by spring 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team won the ‘Managing down cost/Improving value’ Award for their work in achieving efficiencies on the M1 J10-13 Improvement Scheme. This was awarded to suppliers that had demonstrated significant achievement in mobilising all their talents and resources to deliver smarter and more efficient ways of working in delivering HA contracts. Costain-Carillion received the award jointly, with Amey, for its work on Area 9 MAC.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain-Carillion JV team also won the Health and Safety Award for their safety record on the M1 J10-13 Improvement Scheme.   Winners in this category had to show industry leading commitment to improving organisation and workforce health and safety.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The M1 J10-13 Improvement Scheme has an inducted workforce of over 4,000 people and recently achieved one million man-hours injury free, the fourth time the project has reached this milestone since work began on the project in 2009.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team was also highly commended in the ‘Delivering sustainable value and solutions’ category, which is awarded to suppliers that have integrated environmental, social, economic and management aspects of sustainable development into delivery of HA Contracts.<br /> <br />Bruce Richards, the Project Director for the M1 J10-13 Improvement Scheme, added: “We are delighted to have again been recognised by the Highways Agency in their Supplier Recognition Scheme. These awards reflect all the work that has been done by the M1 J10-13 team over the life of the project. Without their dedication and commitment, the success of the scheme and the associated awards would not have been possible.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">21 January 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is stepping up its activities in the Arabian Gulf as the Company expands the range of services it offers in the region.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company has been heavily involved in providing services to the oil and gas industries of Abu Dhabi for more than 30 years but increasingly hopes to promote its consultancy expertise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Former Highways Director, Tim Bowen, moved to Abu Dhabi last autumn with a remit to develop Costain’s consultancy offering. Now Executive Director Middle East, he has spent the past few months evaluating local markets and prospecting for opportunities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain was well-known in the region for construction activities, particularly for large infrastructure works such as Dubai airport’s Terminal One and the emirate’s Port Rashid dock.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company name is still remembered and respected, says Tim. “The market is looking good. The region is cash rich as a result of its petrochemical exports and the Costain name and brand is very much associated with engineering excellence.” That gives Costain an edge in the marketplace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Major infrastructure works are planned in several countries. Qatar, for example, is increasing its water reserves capacity and is embarking on plans to construct vast underground concrete reservoirs capable of holding enough water to increase national reserves.  A new railway system is planned for the UAE, while Abu Dhabi is developing its 27km² Saadiyat Island is into a world-class leisure, residential, business and cultural hub.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain hopes to win a stake in projects such as this through its project management consultancy activities.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Richard Brownson, Costain General Foreman on the Dwr Cymru Welsh Water Framework, is a local hero after helping to rescue a lorry driver who was trapped in his overturned cab.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following an accident on the A55 in North Wales, Richard noticed a cloud of white smoke and immediately pulled over to assist. He could see a man trapped in the back of his meat lorry and instinctively tried to free him from the wreckage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eventually, with the help of a passerby, they smashed the windows and managed to drag out the injured driver. Richard quickly administered First Aid and waited on the scene until the emergency services arrived.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">15 January 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is entering a new chapter of its long-term Aquatrine PFI contract as it uses the project as a base from which to look for new business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aquatrine got underway in March 2005 when Costain and Severn Trent put together a Special Purpose Vehicle, C2C, and won the contract to supply water and wastewater services to around 1,300 Ministry of Defence sites across the North, East and South-East of England.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contract runs to 2030. C2C is responsible for some 4,000 assets and the services include the delivery of over 7 million m<sup>3</sup> of water per year, continuously collecting and disposing of sewage and surface water, and ensuring the water is safe by taking over 70,000 samples each year. The works comprise a mix of capital expenditure, operations, maintenance and customer billing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The early years saw considerable investment spent on bringing the water network up to a modern standard and it met the Government target to cut water consumption by 25 per cent by the year 2020 in 2009 – over a decade ahead of schedule.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, a joint venture, Severn Trent Costain, has been launched on the back of Aquatrine to serve the commercial and industrial market sector. Severn Trent Costain combines the skills and experience of these two companies, operating across Great Britain to provide complete water and wastewater management services for commercial and industrial high volume water users.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of this, C2C will be rebranding its operating companies, C2C Water and C2C Services which will become respectively Severn Trent Costain Water and Severn Trent Costain Services.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">14 January 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ben Ford, a Costain undergraduate engineer at the University of Exeter, has won a regional structural engineering award for his research into using optical fibre sensing to monitor strain within sprayed concrete.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ben won the Student Competition which was organised by the Devon and Cornwall Regional Group of the Institution of Structural Engineers, the world’s largest membership organisation dedicated to the art and science of structural engineering.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Supervised by Dr. Khurram Wadee at the University of Exeter, Ben researched and tested how optical fibre cables could be used to measure performance within structures, before identifying where improvements in their specification, design and installation could be made.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ben started off by identifying what optical fibre strain monitoring was, how it worked, and what its capabilities were. This was achieved through a review of research papers and discussions with Dr Mohammed Elshafie, who leads the Optical Fibre Sensing Group in the Civils Division at Cambridge University’s Engineering Department.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The monitoring of most structures is currently reliant on maintenance teams performing time consuming and costly visual and manual operations, but the use of optical fibre monitoring systems makes it possible to realise continuous, real time and automatic health monitoring of structures,” said Ben.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Through combining standard optical fibre cables with a BOTDR (Brillouin Optical Time Domain Reflectometry) analyser, Ben measured continuous strain profiles within sprayed concrete beams and explored the potential use of this technology within SMART infrastructure and BIM (Building Information Modelling) Level 3.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The technology has the potential to revolutionise the way sprayed concrete tunnels are monitored, but all previous applications of the technology in concrete are based around the optical fibre cables being directly attached to reinforcement within the concrete,” said Ben.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ben, in conjunction with Bonnie Leung, a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Cambridge, conducted an experiment at the University of Cambridge to see how well the cables performed when cast directly into sprayed concrete, without being attached to any reinforcement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the experiment, a sprayed concrete column and a sprayed concrete beam were tested, each cast with optical fibre cables and vibrating wire strain gauges for comparison. The column and the beam were loaded individually in small increments and the strain recorded at each load step by optical fibre cables, vibrating wire strain gauges, Linear Voltage Displacement Transducers (LVDT) and traditional Demec gauges.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Comparisons were made between each of the recorded strains, and analysis carried out to determine the cause of any discrepancies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both sets of optical fibre results accurately measured the strains during the different loading increments as well as identified crack locations, well before they were visually located, within the beam and the column.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ben is being sponsored through university as part of a QUEST Scholarship and is currently in his fourth year of a MEng Civil Engineering course at Exeter. He graduates in June and hopes to start work at Costain in August.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I’m delighted to have won this competition and I want to thank everyone who helped me in my research. A key outcome of my work was to promote the capabilities of optical fibre monitoring to the engineering community, and presenting and winning this competition will help to do that,” said Ben.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on Ben’s award, Sarah Buck, Chair of the judging panel and a former President of the Institution of Structural Engineers said: "Ben’s presentation on the use of fibre optic cables in sprayed concrete particularly impressed the judges. Ben presented his subject confidently and clearly, whilst his response to questions from the judging panel demonstrated his in-depth knowledge of the subject at both a technical and practical level. He is a worthy winner of the first prize of the Devon and Cornwall Regional Group Student Presentation Competition and he is credit to Exeter University and Costain."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tim Embley, Costain’s Group Innovation and Knowledge Manager, added: “Innovation is part of Costain’s culture and I congratulate Ben on his award. Our research and innovation programme, along with our research partners like Cambridge University, aims to develop innovative solutions to improve our customers’ businesses.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">11 January 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Severn Trent Costain* has opened its new, green headquarters complete with a 24/7/365 response control centre and a host of water and energy efficiency features.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The relocation follows the announcement that leading UK dairy, First Milk, had become the first business customer to switch to the joint venture since the regulations in England were changed to allow businesses using over the new lower threshold of 5ML of water a year to choose their supplier.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 150-strong head office team is now consolidated at Parkside, Birmingham Business Park, a cental location at the heart of the UK’s major transport and infrastructure networks, which enables easy communication with the joint venture’s numerous regional offices. The completely refurbished building contains state-of-the-art facilities including hot desking and the latest IT systems, enabling its position as a central business hub to be optimised for the benefit of customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you might expect from a Company which partners with customers to make more efficient use of their water resources and enhance sustainability, the new HQ incorporates a host of environmental and safety-friendly features.  These include everything from water-efficient aerated sensor taps to hot water dispensers for tea and coffee. Power saving is also very much in evidence, including automatic lighting that switches off when meeting rooms are empty, plus working practices to drive waste reduction and recycling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even the move from the old offices was handled in the greenest possible way with old furniture recycled in an environment friendly manner. IT equipment was distributed to two local schools and newer, reusable furniture was donated to a health centre, schools and charities. Unwanted stationery and other small office items were collected and given to ‘Sense’, a charity that provides support for deaf-blind people which is based in central Birmingham.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Severn Trent Costain’s Managing Director, Wayne Earp, said: “I am delighted that the head office team is now together in this fantastic central location. This gives an extra boost to our drive to provide innovative water management solutions for our customers right across the country”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">8 January 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has secured financial support from the Department of Environment and Climate Change (DECC) through a £20million programme for finding novel solutions to reduce the cost of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the climate change agenda, the UK Government held a CCS Innovation competition looking for new ideas to further harness the potential of carbon capture technologies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, Edward Davey, recently said: “Carbon Capture and Storage is a huge opportunity for our world class research industry. Through the projects we have selected, pioneering companies and universities will be able to create new jobs and expand their markets.” </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has been selected to develop two innovative technologies which aim to reduce the cost of low-carbon electricity generation through reducing the cost associated with carbon capture, and will work in cooperation with renowned UK universities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In collaboration with the University of Edinburgh, Costain will investigate a novel concept for the design and construction of cheaper absorber columns to be used for post-combustion carbon capture in coal and gas power plants.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An improved oxyfuel capture technology will also be developed together with the University of Edinburgh and the University of Leeds, which will study innovative carbon dioxide separation and compression technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently Costain is also developing unique next generation Carbon Capture technology together with the Energy Technologies Institute, which is expected to improve efficiencies and reduce capital cost for power generation in Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle power plants, while achieving a very high carbon capture rate of 95%.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bryony Livesey, Research and Technology Manager said: “I am delighted that Costain has secured these two projects from DECC’s Innovation competition. We look forward to working with our partners at the Universities of Edinburgh and Leeds to develop new technologies which can play a key role in reducing the costs of carbon capture and storage in the UK.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">7 January 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first ideas to flow from the Costain Start-ups programme are now operational or at the development stage, as the Company taps into the expertise of its staff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The scheme, launched last summer, aims to encourage personnel with good business ideas that align with the Company’s strategy. If these ideas are approved, Costain will help develop and invest in them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, overseeing the launch of Costain Start-ups (the Company has invested in one idea and is considering four more) is part of the work being undertaken by Group Strategy Director, Ross Agnew.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After 18 months in the new role, which grew out of the former Group Business Development and Strategy position, he is well into developing and implementing initiatives that can strengthen the Company’s future prospects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He works on the development of strategy with the Executive Board, but also gets involved in ‘transformational opportunities’ directly with our customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of those opportunities is the innovative Severn Trent/Costain Joint Venture (JV) launched last year to provide complete water and wastewater management services for high-volume users in the industrial and commercial sectors.  “We’re embedded right in there, working with Severn Trent Water’s strategy team to develop that opportunity,” noted Ross and the JV has recently won its first customer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Several further potential JVs are under consideration. One, with BAE Systems subsidiary Detica, would look at future ‘smart city’ concepts such as pulling together information on maintenance activities, while another with IBM would investigate possession optimisation for railway repairs and integrated operations centres for rail customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From a personal viewpoint, Ross views his role as being part of the team implementing the projects and not just working on developing the ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another aspect of his job involves ensuring that everyone in the Company is pushing in the same direction: “A Sector Director may have a good idea of where he wants to take that sector and part of my role is to align that with the direction of the Group.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">2 January 2013</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first new vehicle crossing point to be built across the River Thames for 20 years is taking shape as a Costain team spans the river between Walton-on-Thames and Shepperton.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The area has been served for many years by two bridges that were intended to be temporary links. A road bridge was built in the 1950s as a replacement for a war-damaged structure. It now caters purely for pedestrians and cyclists, while another temporary bridge that opened in 1999 carries road traffic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contract for the new bridge was originally awarded by Surrey County Council in 2005 but the project has been the subject of two public inquiries and was put on hold during a government spending review. Costain started detailed design for the final time in 2011, with some advance works getting underway the same year and actual construction starting in January 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bridge’s design is known as a ‘thrust arch’ – similar to the more familiar ‘bowstring arch’. The striking arches have recently been put in place. When complete, the bridge will have a clear span of 90 metres, but this figure rises to 148 metres when taking into account the entire structure and links in to existing roads.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Technical challenges, says Project Manager Andy Bannister, include poor ground conditions on the Walton-on-Thames side of the river. Costain will build a separate viaduct over a flood plain to link up with the bridge itself. Other factors to be negotiated include the presence of the Thames Pathway, which goes through the job site: “There’s a huge public and business interface,” says Andy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The bridge is due to be handed over around summer 2013. The old bridges will then be demolished, with final tie-in works and landscaping to be completed in spring 2014.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">20 December 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 4Delivery Brighton &amp; Hove (4D) project team (joint venture including Costain) recently collected two National Construction Awards and nine medals at a ceremony in London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The awards recognise the achievements of individuals and businesses associated with 4D’s work on Southern Water’s £300m environmental improvement scheme, which aims to bring cleaner seas to Sussex by delivering ground-breaking solutions, as part of the National Skills Academy for Construction (NSAfC) scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4D’s first award was for Contribution to Management and Leadership Success through the delivery of Costain Behavioural Safety (CBS) training.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The behavioural safety approach was first adopted on the 4D SEC programme in 2005. CBS pioneers the scientific study of behaviour in order to provide solutions to practical problems in the workplace and community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It now forms an integral part of the Group’s overall safety, health and environment programme through Costain Cares, which aims to address the growing needs of its stakeholders, including its employees, through greater corporate responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the programme’s inception, 4D has achieved the equivalent of over seven million injury free man-hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second award was for the team’s contribution to Community Engagement, with Costain’s James York, a Community Relations Manager, picking up the award on the team’s behalf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">James and the project team put in a great deal of work to ensure local residents were kept informed about the project’s progress and the benefits it would bring. For example, over the course of the project, the team welcomed over 1,700 visitors for a tour of the wastewater treatment works site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team also forged strong links with local schools, colleges and universities, including two successful tunnel-boring machine naming competitions for local school children.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NSAfC Project Lead, George Hilliar, said: “I am delighted that 4D has been recognised by the National Skills Academy for these awards as it demonstrates the commitment of the project team, our supply chain and our client, Southern Water.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">NSAfC is led by CITB-ConstructionSkills, the Sector Skills Council for the construction industry, and an organisation with over 40 years’ experience of successfully meeting the training needs of the industry.  The organisation is a project-based training concept that is tailored to helping clients and contractors get the right skills where they need them, which is on site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting, Judy Lowe, Deputy Chairman of CITB-Construction Skills, added: “The NSAfC initiative is helping to ensure that we have a construction workforce with the right skills for the right project in the right place.  Through the scheme, we are seeing a culture change, embedding employment and skills as an integral part of the delivery of construction projects.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">18 December 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Alan Cheung recently showcased the success of the Costain Behavioural Safety (CBS) programme at an industry conference in the United States.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alan, who works as Costain’s CBS Director for Behavioural Management, delivered a keynote speech to over 500 people at the Behavioural Safety Now Conference in Florida, the largest behavioural safety conference in the world. Now in its 17th year, the conference includes an educational programme for all levels of management, safety professionals and employee teams with an interest in behavioural safety.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In his speech, “Behavioural Leadership – A way of life” Alan talked about how Costain’s behavioural safety programme was implemented across the Company. He also talked about the importance of creating an environment where, through exhibiting leadership, everyone in the Company - from working on-site to working in the office - understood the importance of taking responsibility for their own safety and those around them.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“When we introduced behavioural safety into the business in 2006, we realised it was about more than just safety. Our behavioural safety programme has never just been about introducing lots of work-related observations, in fact for large parts of our business that simply wouldn’t work. What our programme needed to deliver was a successful culture change, a culture where people did the right things because they wanted to. We had to get our leaders to understand their own behaviour, learn the behavioural science and apply it to everything they did, whether that be to time, cost, quality, customers and the safety aspects of their role,” said Alan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alan also delivered a workshop at the conference called “Behavioural Leadership – A Way of Life – how we achieved it,” which was attended by over 40 people and looked at the practicalities of making behavioural safety a success in the workplace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CBS now forms an integral part of the Group’s overall safety, health, and environment programme through Costain Cares, which aims to address the growing needs of its stakeholders, including its employees, through greater corporate responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain was accredited by The Cambridge Centre for Behavioural Studies (CCBS), an independent non-profit organisation, in January 2012 and the Company became the first in the UK to be accredited for its behavioural safety programme.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">17 December 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain team working on the Dwr Cymru Welsh Water Framework, welcomed fifteen local students to the site of a new service reservoir at Coed Dolwyd, Glan Conwy, to help develop their skills and provide encouragement for the future construction workers within the local industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The students from Coleg Llandrillo, who are studying a BTEC in construction, were given an exclusive behind the scenes look of the site to see ‘first hand’ what goes into the development of such a significant project. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The day was tailored to support the students in their studies with a particular focus on health and safety, the design, programme, procurement, site procedures, and technology and techniques used during the construction process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dave Roberto, Higher Education Co-ordinator from Coleg Llandrillo, said: “The visit was a great opportunity for the students to gain a first-hand perspective into the construction process of a large scale project. The team did a really good job in bringing to life key concepts of the construction process.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Madden, Framework Director said: “It’s important for us to encourage and develop the skills of the next generation of our workforce. We’d been working closely with the college leading up to the visit and tailored the day to ensure that key areas of the BTEC course were covered. It was a pleasure to welcome such an inquisitive set of students and we wish them all the best for their futures within the industry.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new 25 megalitre service reservoir at Coed Dolwyd, Glan Conwy will provide additional storage for treated water and will benefit people in Llandudno, Colwyn Bay, the Conwy Valley and surrounding areas. It will enable Welsh Water to store enough drinking water to supply the needs of customers during the highest demand periods, and stop those at the extremities of this water supply network from experiencing low water pressure.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>13 December 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has won another accolade from the Institution of Civil Engineers after one of its staff received the annual James Hill Prize for a paper published spring 2011 and the paper has now been selected for presentation as part of the ICE’s Prestige Papers series in 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The James Hill award, goes to the best paper published in the Municipal Engineer Journal, and was presented in October to Chris Mannall, Costain’s Process Design Manager, and his co-author, Martin Chinn from Viridor Laing (Greater Manchester) ltd on the Greater Manchester Recycling and Waste contract. Their submission was entitled ‘Environmental benefits of new waste management facilities in Manchester, UK’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Greater Manchester Recycling and Waste contract has invested a total of £630million in waste treatment facilities of which £400million has been spent on state-of-the-art facilities serving a population of 2.27 million people in Greater Manchester (engineered and delivered by Costain) and the balance on a Combined Heat and Power plant in Runcorn, Cheshire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The paper details the environmental benefits of the facilities including increased recycling rates with consequential embedded carbon reduction in future products, optimisation of carbon impact from transportation, green generation of energy (electricity and heat), diversion from landfill and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, nutrient capture and finally better environmental performance of waste management facilities in urban locations including odour control.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The paper concludes by comparing the improvements being made to infrastructure for dealing with municipal waste to the improvements made to our wastewater infrastructure by the Victorians in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The paper is just one of five selected for the ICE Prestige Papers series presented between January and June 2013.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>12 December 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s involvement in the NHS Procure 21 programme has ended on a high note with a project winning a trio of prizes in the Building Better Healthcare (BBH) Awards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Discovery House in Lincoln, a mental health rehabilitation facility in the grounds of the city’s St George’s Hospital, was entered for four awards and took three of them – Best Project Team, Best Technology for Improving the Patient Experience and Patient’s Choice. It was a finalist in the Best Interior Design category.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 45-bed, £11.5 million building was completed in December 2011 for the Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust. It was the last Costain project to be completed under Procure 21.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Its design was radically changed from a square with ‘fingers’ to an arc, in order to minimise its visual presence to nearby householders, but its construction was relatively straightforward, said Project Manager, Kevin Miners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It impressed the BBH judges, outclassing several prestigious buildings up for awards in its categories.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the ‘Best Technology for Improving the Patient Experience’ category, for example, they commented: “This is a thoughtful, caring and versatile building design that sought to involve patients, staff and carers from the very outset. It is a lovely concept and the patients say they really value it.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And one of the service users of Discovery House described it as “by far the best mental health inpatient facility I have ever seen – and I have almost 42 years’ experience of such places”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It also drew praise in the Best Project Team category for having involved a wide spectrum of stakeholders in encouraging user and community engagement.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>10 December 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Natural Resources Division has taken a step to improve further its already high safety standards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Division is adding a greater focus on process safety to its existing portfolio of occupational safety measures. The resulting policy is known as Total Safety.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Process safety focuses on the potential for major accidents arising from the release of energy, chemicals or other substances and is the systematic approach to reduce and mitigate any risk associated with the design or operation of facilities where these hazards are present.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The need for safety in these situations is paramount,” said John Meakin, Operations Director for the Natural Resources Division.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Accidents, whilst very rare, pose potentially severe consequences to people and the environment. Ensuring that we have the best safety procedures and working practices in place demands that we rigorously test them and compare them to industry-acknowledged leading standards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To achieve the required standards, Costain will be implementing the Energy Institute’s (EI) ‘High Level Framework for Process Safety Management’. The EI is a nationally recognised professional body for the energy industry that delivers best practice and professionalism across the sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Before committing to the EI framework, and to get an independent perspective on our existing safety systems, we commissioned an independent consultant to review our strategy and current practices. The key findings positively endorsed both our current safety systems and the decision to adopt the framework.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To help this become a reality, we will be appointing a Divisional Safety Director who will be accountable for Process Safety Management within Costain. The Director will be responsible for ensuring that process safety is being implemented in line with the EI framework, putting necessary procedures in place and getting the commitment of staff to make sure these procedures are being implemented.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">6 December 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">United Utilities and Costain’s joint venture with GallifordTry and Atkins, GCA, have won a top environmental award for the work on the High Lane Service Reservoir in Stockport, Cheshire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project received a Silver Award from Green Apple for demonstrating Environmental Best Practice in the construction of a 28 mega litre (28 million litres) service reservoir at the Wybersley Water Treatment Works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Green Apple Awards are organised by The Green Organisation, an independent, non-political, non-activist, non-profit environment group dedicated to recognising, rewarding and promoting environmental best practice around the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new reservoir will ensure the supply of drinking water to homes and businesses in the Stockport Metropolitan Borough which includes Stockport, Wilmslow, Macclesfield, Whaley Bridge, Disley and High Lane.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project was recognised for protecting the wider environment by minimising traffic movement, reducing the materials required and the waste produced by developing sustainable solutions at every stage of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In its assessment, Green Apple applauded the United Utilities and GCA team for retaining and reusing all excavated materials and for optimising the use of site aggregates elsewhere on the project;  for minimising the need for excavation by using advanced geotechnical analysis and design; for employing innovative solutions to reduce the need to use concrete assisting in a significant reduction in the sites carbon footprint; for developing a solution to manage surface water run-off and for minimising pollution by working with its partners and the Environment Agency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team was also commended for its close community and customer engagement, which addressed any issues from local residents promptly and proactively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Green Apple said the GCA JV’s wider programme of works with United Utilities will benefit from the Best Practice solutions demonstrated on the site and bring long-term sustainable benefits to the local area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It added that the team’s positive ‘can do’ culture enabled the whole site team to engage with, and see the benefits of, employing measures which were environmentally sustainable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The award submission was compiled by United Utilities, GCA’s Environmental Team and the High Lane site team.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the Award, Richard Helme, GCA’s Senior Site Manager at High Lane, said: “The team is delighted to have been recognised for this award. The scheme was specifically designed from its concept stages to reduce the potential for adverse environmental effects and extensive measures were taken to reduce the effects of the construction process, including a restriction on working hours, traffic safety and the construction of a grassed earth mound to reduce the effects of noise and dust.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">6 December 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Water consumers in Wales are seeing steadily improving standards as Costain proceeds with its AMP 5 framework agreement with Dŵr Cymru Welsh Water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is just over halfway through the AMP 5 period, which is worth an estimated £50 million. With the previous AMP 4 period having seen a cluster of projects designed to ensure Welsh Water reached European water and wastewater quality standards, there is greater emphasis in this round on maintaining those standards, says Costain’s Framework Director, John Madden.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among larger projects currently being tackled are the creation of a 25-million litre service reservoir outside Conwy and two large underground storage tanks at Heswall, on The Wirral.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The service reservoir is designed to create a large head of water that ensures pressure is maintained by gravity feed through the pipe network. This particularly helps consumers at the end of distribution networks who would otherwise suffer from low water pressure from their taps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The two Wirral storage tanks will allow wastewater to be stored for treatment rather than being flushed straight out to sea, so that shellfish in the Dee Estuary are not contaminated by excessive effluent outflows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the last major new facilities completed since AMP 5 came into effect was the Five Fords wastewater treatment works, the largest plant of its type in North Wales; Costain was responsible for the civil engineering works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One noteworthy part of Costain’s work at Five Fords was construction of the digestion tanks, where bacteria break down waste. Gases given off by the process are collected and used to generate enough power not only to make the plant self-sufficient but also to export surplus electricity to the National Grid.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">27 November 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain Carillion JV has reached another major safety milestone on the M1 Junction 10-13 project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project, which has an inducted workforce of over 4,000 people, has again achieved one million man-hours injury free. It is the fourth time the project has reached this milestone since work began on the project in 2009 and to celebrate the team decided to donate £500 to Leagrave Primary School in Luton.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The school, which has 428 pupils aged between 3 and 11 years old, is adjacent to the southbound carriageway of the M1 near junction 11 where Costain Carillion is working on a managed motorways scheme on behalf of the Highways Agency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new managed motorway scheme, which aims to relieve congestion by using technology to vary the speed limit, went live between Junctions 10 and 11 in July 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By using the hard shoulder at peak times to create additional capacity as a running lane, otherwise known as "hard shoulder running,” the scheme is able to increase road capacity without the need to acquire additional land.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Overhead electronic signals will display variable mandatory speed limits and overhead message signs will indicate when drivers can use the hard shoulder as an extra lane. Work is due to completed by spring 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Martin Griffiths, CCJV Community Relations Manager and Tom George, CCJV SHE Advisor, visited the school on Strangers Way, in Bedfordshire, to keep staff informed about the project’s progress and to talk to the pupils about the project and the importance of safety.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Priti Naran, School Business Manager at Leagrave Primary School, said: “We would like to say a big thank you to the Costain Carillion JV for their donation, which we will use to develop an outdoor play area for the children, and for taking the time to speak to the children about the importance of safety on our roads and in the work place.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Martin Kuhn, Project SHE Manager for the scheme, added: “We’re delighted to have reached another significant safety milestone on this project and to be able to donate to the school. The staff and pupils at Leagrave Primary School have always been polite and accommodating to us as we worked next to their school, which included working on the embankment alongside their field.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">26 November 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is helping develop an innovative system for use in the nuclear industry as part of an initiative to bring forward new technology in the sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Government‘s Technology Strategy Board has provided £70,000 – together with internal funding from Costain – to allow the Group and one of its technology partners to develop an ‘augmented reality’ device. This is designed to help staff undertake maintenance work on existing nuclear power stations, construct new-build stations or help decommission old ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The idea is that you go on to a site with a handheld computer or tablet, hold it up, stream what you can see through the device’s camera and it is overlaid with computer information,” explained Matt Blackwell, Costain’s Group BIM Manager.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“For example, you would hold it up to a valve and it would tell you when the valve was last maintained, who maintained it and when it next required maintenance. It would also give you a method statement on how to change the valve.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The idea came from work we’re doing on the London Bridge Station contract. There, we use augmented reality to demonstrate what aspects such as temporary works and hoardings will look like.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’re very focused on supplying innovative solutions to our customers,” commented Group Innovation Manager, Tim Embley.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Due to the growth of the nuclear sector, we’ve been looking at a range of services we can supply. Augmented Reality allows frontline maintenance teams to have access to information right at the point where they need it.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain and its innovation partner believe the new system will also be useful at the decommissioning ends of the nuclear spectrum, said Nuclear Development Director, Alistair Smith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In decommissioning a nuclear plant, for example, the overlay could show which areas of a building or individual room had higher areas of radioactivity, so personnel could avoid them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“You could wear a head-mounted display to ‘see’ radioactivity. By augmenting the view you would know where you wouldn’t want to stand for very long, or how you would need to dismantle a particular valve while minimising your radioactive dose.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>22 November 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is pioneering the use of innovative web-based software to ensure the lights stay on in the UK’s largest and busiest city.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tunnel Information Management, or TIM, has been developed by The Commercial Applications Company with and for London Bridge Associates (LBA), a Strategic Partner of Costain, and is now being employed on the London Power Tunnels project for National Grid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain won the £220m contract in 2010 to build the new HV cable tunnels between Hackney and Willesden (via St John’s Wood) and Kensal Green and Wimbledon. The new tunnels are essential for ensuring London has sufficient transmission infrastructure to support future energy demand.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">TIM provides real time quality information and allows the site team to make production management and maintenance decisions quickly and accurately by focussing valuable time and effort on areas that can make a real difference to the success of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project includes the construction of 32km of 4.0mID and 3.0mID tunnels, which are being driven by two new tunnel boring machines (TBMs) working at an average depth of between 30 and 40 metres.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, being able to check on the team’s progress and analyse any potential problems before they happen is vital to its success.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We believe the gathering and analysis of high quality data provides the foundation for improving our operational performance. Using TIM allows us to keep on top of what we are doing by highlighting areas for continuous improvement,” said Andrew Firth, Project Manager.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Data is inputted into the TBMs via an internet link as the shift progresses, which reduces the need for paper records. The system is web-based and can be accessed from any location by multiple users simultaneously and can be accessed from a tablet or smart phone. User access to specific data is clearly defined with a permission to read, write or delete information, while the data is securely backed up and saved every three hours. Furthermore, data is based around coded activities that allow for easy analysis, and also includes quality and other information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">TIM uses the data to create reports on progress, delay analysis, quality, geology, consumables usage and key performance indicators (KPIs), all of which are available on a real time basis. Pdf reports can be automatically generated and distributed by email and tabulated data can be exported to Excel for further analysis. Early warnings are highlighted on screen and can be emailed to specific members of staff while the home page includes a map showing the current TBM locations for display in the site offices and visitor centre.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">TIM reports are then analysed by the Construction and Engineering teams in the Daily Review Meeting. The team’s performance, and that of the TBMs, over the previous 24 hours is reviewed and actions for improvement are assigned.  Weekly progress and section meetings similarly use TIM reports to drive improvement. The accumulated information then assists with handover records and can provide continuing information to asset owners, operators and maintenance personnel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on TIM, John Trounson, National Grid’s Senior Project Manager for Capital Delivery, said:  “National Grid is always looking for new ways to innovate in order to enhance safety performance and improve efficiency.  In providing real time information, the TIM system is an essential tool in identifying operational constraints which can help us to improve in both these areas whilst providing a contemporary record of the tunnel drives.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>21 November 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sharp-eyed personnel on National Grid’s London Power Tunnels project have helped raise enough money to allow future Paralympic dreams to be pursued by a group of young athletes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past two years, staff from Costain (together with colleagues from Skanska, a major partner on the project) have generated £1 from the companies for every ‘observation card’ they have completed. The observations highlight aspects of work that require reactive or corrective action. The charity scheme also includes ‘success nominations’, underscoring National Grid’s active encouragement of safe behaviour and reporting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So far the scheme has raised over £4,700.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pledged cash was contributed to The Lord’s Taverners charity, in order to fund initiatives such as their Junior Wheelchair Basketball Development Programme and will be sufficient to buy sports wheelchairs for an entire squad of wheelchair basketball players –nine young people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Lord’s Taverners provide a lot of sports wheelchairs and so get favourable rates from their supplier. This allows us to create more impact from the money we donate,” said Costain Community Relations Manager, Martin Griffiths.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cheque handover took place at Lord’s cricket ground in London, with a group of young Paralympians in attendance before they headed for Buckingham Palace and a reception with The Queen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the UK’s success in this summer’s Paralympic Games, the new wheelchairs will hopefully help inspire future disabled athletes to take up the sport.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It was a great afternoon,” said Martin. “The Lord’s Taverners have agreed to supply a framed copy of the photograph that you see here that can be hung in reception at the Channel Gate Road site. Then we could highlight the project charity and what the money from staff observation cards actually does.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>21 November 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has been recognised at a prestigious investor relations awards ceremony in London for its latest Annual Report.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain won the Most Effective Overall Annual Report (Printed and Online) in the Small Cap &amp; AIM category at the Investor Relations Society’s (IR Society) Best Practice Awards held at The Pavilion, The Tower of London, on 20th November 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now in its 12th year, the IR Society Best Practice Awards recognise and reward best practice in investor communications, both online and in print.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The awards, which were attended by around 450 people from across the investor relations and corporate communications industry, were compered and presented by former Conservative Party politician and Cabinet Minister Michael Portillo.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The IR Society is the professional body for those involved in investor relations and is the focal point for investor relations in the UK.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The awards’ winners are determined through a robust, three-part review process. All entries are reviewed and scored against a checklist, based on the Society’s Best Practice guidelines, and the specific criteria for each award, set out in the awards entry form.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the award, the judges said: “Costain Group presented a clear and easy to navigate report with the Remuneration Committee content being a particular feature.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Investor relations is a strategic management function that incorporates finance, communication, marketing and strict compliance with stock exchange listing rules to enable the most effective two-way communication between a company, the financial community, its shareholders and stakeholders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain started to integrate its financial and corporate responsibility reporting into its Annual Report four years ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This allowed shareholders and other stakeholders to better gauge how the company performed financially and, through the successful implementation of Costain Cares initiative launched in May 2011, see how it conducted its business in the communities in which it operated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Catherine Warbrick, Costain’s Corporate responsibility Director, said: “We are delighted to have been recognised by the Investor Relations Society for our 2011 Annual Report, which showcases our approach to business. Through Costain Cares we are building a more responsible, longer-term sustainable business that creates economic, environmental and social value for all stakeholders.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>19 November 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, one of the UK’s leading engineering solutions providers, today announces the formation of a new Natural Resources operating division as part of the further transformation of the Group to align closely with its customers’ evolving requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new division will encompass the Water, Hydrocarbons &amp; Chemicals, Nuclear Process and Waste sectors, combining the existing Energy &amp; Process and Environment Divisions. The division will enable Costain to combine further its front end process engineering, project delivery, and operations capability into an integrated service for customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Managing Director for the new division will be Mark Rogerson MBE. Mark joined Costain from Serco earlier this year and has been promoted from his previous role of Chief Development Officer. He has a track record of successfully managing and growing support service businesses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Natural Resources division will operate alongside the Infrastructure Division, which will now also include all Power Sector activities. The Infrastructure division will continue to be led by Managing Director Darren James.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, Alan Kay, previously Managing Director of the Environment Division, and who has just completed the Advanced Management Programme at Harvard Business School, will take on the new role of Group Technical &amp; Operations Director on the Executive Board to drive innovation, operational and engineering excellence across the Group. Charles Sweeney, previously Managing Director of Energy &amp; Process, has decided to pursue opportunities elsewhere after nine years with the Company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain continues to perform well as a result of the implementation of its ‘Choosing Costain’ strategy, which focuses on providing lifecycle services in the design, delivery and maintenance of assets for major blue-chip customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Andrew Wyllie, Costain Group Chief Executive, said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“As part of the planned transformation of Costain we have formed this new Natural Resources Division committed to delivering an innovative and integrated service across engineering consultancy, construction and operations and maintenance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I would like to thank Charles for his service to the Company and I look forward to working with Mark and Alan in their new roles.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">16 November 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has joined Oil &amp; Gas UK as part of a continuous commitment to develop its upstream oil and gas business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oil &amp; Gas UK is the leading representative body of the UK offshore oil and gas industry with membership including ‘super-major’ oil companies and some of the largest engineering contractors in the sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s upstream oil &amp; gas business based in Aberdeen, ClerkMaxwell, has doubled in size in the last twelve months, with the award of several framework agreements for North Sea operators.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Charles Sweeney, Managing Director of Costain Energy &amp; Process said: “We have delivered a number of leading-edge projects which have required innovative thinking and fast-track processes, one example being the development of an enhanced oil recovery project which will substantially extend the life of the field for the customer.” He added, “We are committed to developing Costain’s market presence in the upstream sector and membership of Oil &amp; Gas UK will provide a perfect forum for us to contribute to the industry.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sector is enjoying an upsurge in capital investment, estimated to be worth up to £11.5bn during 2012 and the Chancellor has recently announced tax allowances that will make a number of brownfield projects more attractive as investment opportunities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Malcolm Webb, Oil &amp; Gas UK’s Chief Executive said: “We are delighted that Costain, a leading engineering solutions provider, has joined the Oil &amp; Gas UK family. By joining us, Costain will be able to network with potential new customers, benefit from our market insight into the sector and help shape the industry’s future in the UK.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>15 November 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain personnel at the Phillips 66 Humber Refinery site and its satellites at Immingham, Lincolnshire, have marked the remarkable achievement of eight years since their last recordable accident. It is also nearly three years since the last incident that required first aid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Infrastructure Support Services Divisional Manager, Ian Tully, puts the success down to two things: attention to detail and a policy of ‘My brother’s keeper’ – looking out for colleagues and, if necessary, intervening if potentially unsafe practices are seen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team of around 40 staff based on the refinery provides a range of services predominantly civil engineering and construction but are supported by an industrial services team based at a facility in Immingham.  Typical work for the team would be civils maintenance involving concreting, Tarmacing, deep excavations and drainage. In addition, the Projects team carries out similar work but on a larger scale.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The drive for impeccable safety standards intensified following an incident in October 2004, says Ian. “We had quite a serious injury to one of our chaps. After that, we just did things a bit differently, with focus on our behaviour rather than relying on procedures.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Attention to detail takes many forms. For instance, Ian began to insist some years ago that joiners coming on-site should wear safety gloves. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Persistence paid off and gloves are now an everyday part of equipment for such trades.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The policy of ‘my brother’s keeper’ “has been absolutely vital” in helping head off accidents, he adds. “There can be around 2,000 contractors during peak periods such as Shutdowns on this site. We’ve said that people’s actions can impact on what we do and if we see something wrong, we intervene.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Near-miss reporting is carried out and weekly toolbox talks take place in the site mess room and we are active members of Client / Contractor Safety forums.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“As a small incentive for continuing to keep a spotless record, a social ‘Team Building’ evening is held for team members and their partners if six months pass without an accident.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Similar success has been recorded at a ConocoPhillips site at Theddlethorpe, with no safety incidents over the past five years.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>14 November 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has donated over £22,000 to Great Ormond Street Hospital’s Raising the Roof appeal, which will go towards upgrading their world renowned Neuroscience Centre.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Earlier this year, Costain instigated an Enhanced Transfer Value offer and a Pension Increase Exchange offer to members of The Costain Pension Scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was aimed at offering scheme members greater choice and flexibility regarding their pension entitlement and Costain the opportunity to reduce the overall pension liabilities and risk remaining within the scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain considered it important that all members fully understood the offer and sought financial advice.  The Company decided to make a donation of £10 to Great Ormond Street Hospital for each member who contacted the appointed independent financial advisor, Oval Financial Services Limited. During the offer period, 2,246 members contacted Oval.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Martin Hunter, Sarah Barton and Lisa Bravery presented a cheque to Great Ormond Street Hospital’s Christina Panayiotou.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Raising the Roof will help fund the hospital’s new J N and Phyllis Somers Neurosciences Centre which is part of the hospital’s major redevelopment programme. Since its launch in January 2010, the appeal has raised over £2million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Great Ormond Street Hospital’s Neurosciences department provides care for children with complex neurological disorders, with conditions affecting the central nervous system such as epilepsy, craniofacial disorders and cancers. It is the largest centre for children needing brain surgery and among the largest epilepsy surgery centres in Europe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The J N and Phyllis Somers Neurosciences Centre combines the most comprehensive clinical services in the UK with world-class pioneering research and training. The centre’s Koala Ward, which opened in June, currently has 24 beds and the hospital has plans to increase capacity by adding 10 further beds in 2016.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The donation is in line with Costain Cares, the Company’s long-term operational initiative to address the growing needs of its stakeholders, including its shareholders and the communities it serves, through greater corporate responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are delighted to have this opportunity to be able to donate to Great Ormond Street Hospital’s Raising the Roof appeal. The hospital’s J N and Phyllis Somers Neurosciences Centre  offers world-class treatment to around 8,000 children from all around the world and this appeal will help the unit to expand its capacity and continue its excellent work,” said Catherine Warbrick, Costain’s Corporate Responsibility Director.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting, Great Ormond Street’s Christina Panayiotou, added: “On behalf of everyone at Great Ormond Street Hospital Children’s Charity, we would like to say a heartfelt thank you to Costain for their incredibly generous donation. It will help to make such a huge difference to the Neurosciences team and crucially to our patients and their families.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">13 November 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain and a group of leading trade organisations are calling on the Government to do more to address some of the biggest infrastructure challenges facing the country over the next decade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The UK faces many challenges: increased congestion on its roads, uncertainty about how the country’s future energy needs will be met, a widening skills gap and the prospect of rising youth unemployment. All risk potentially hampering the country’s economic recovery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to address these challenges, Costain, along with a group of leading trade bodies called the Infrastructure Alliance (IA) and CITB-ConstructionSkills, the Sector Skills Council for the UK construction industry, are urging the Government to address the country’s future infrastructure needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The IA includes the Association for Consultancy and Engineering (ACE), the Civil Engineering Contractors Association (CECA), the Construction Products Association (CPA) and the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All parties are calling on the Government to adopt a consistent approach to delivering infrastructure projects in order to deliver on the Government’s National Infrastructure Plan, which outlines the scale of the challenges facing UK infrastructure and the major investment that is needed to underpin sustainable growth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A safe, reliable and well maintained infrastructure network is essential for the future prosperity of the country and to ensure the successful delivery of goods and services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When the National Infrastructure Plan was published in October 2010, it identified the need to invest £200 billion over five years in the energy, transport, waste, flood, science, water and telecoms sectors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The argument for increased infrastructure investment is compelling. In a report called ‘Backing the Construction Sector to Generate Jobs’, the CBI cites research from LEK which estimates that for every £1 invested in construction, the country gets back £2.84 in economic activity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The benefit to local economies is also considerable, with over 90p in every £1 of construction spending retained locally and 93% of the supply chain sourced domestically, which creates jobs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Darren James, Costain’s Managing Director for Infrastructure, recently delivered a speech to the Liberal Democrats’ annual conference in Brighton on behalf of the IA calling for a rebalancing of infrastructure investment throughout the UK.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In his speech, Darren said that while the Government has responded well to calls for assistance from the construction industry by reforming the planning system and creating Infrastructure UK, more needs to be done to tackle youth unemployment and skills training.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With youth unemployment just under one million, the CBI believes that supporting young people into sustainable jobs has to be a top priority if the UK is to avoid a lost generation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We want to generate the engineers of the future in UK schools, colleges and universities. To do this we need to match training to demand and analyse planned investment to identify the skills we need to create a world class workforce,” said Darren.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Darren said the IA is calling for a clear set of actions in each sector and for a realistic assessment of how priority projects and programmes will be paid for, and how skills and training can be provided, in order to ensure projects are delivered on time and on budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain is committed to shaping training opportunities around skills shortages and job opportunities across the construction industry. Through the Infrastructure Alliance, we hope to bring these issues to the forefront of the Government’s thinking on infrastructure, skills and training,” said Darren.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">12 November 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, a leading engineering solutions provider, is pleased to announce that it has been awarded a four-year technology contract by the Welsh Government and has also been appointed onto both lots of the Highways Agency Asset Support Framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Highways Technology Contract</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The four-year technology contract, worth around £15m, is for the maintenance of Road Network Communications and Tunnel Systems across Wales. It involves routine maintenance and fault repair of technology systems such as CCTV cameras, variable messaging signs (VMS), emergency telephones and traffic signals and includes the strategic routes of the M4, A55, and Conwy tunnels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain will commence the new service in early 2013, following a transition and handover period.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Appointment to Asset Support Framework</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Highways Agency (“the Agency”) Asset Support Framework augments the Agency’s Asset Support Contracts by allowing it to call on suppliers, including Costain, for larger maintenance schemes and improvement works, up to the value of £15m each. Costain has been successfully appointed to the framework for both the North and South lots.<br /> <br />While there is no commitment by the Agency to spend under the framework, over £750m of work packages are expected to be awarded through the framework over the next three years. Costain is one of five contractors on each framework that will operate for three years, with scope for an extension of up to a further 12 months. The contract start date is 5th November 2012.    <br /> <br />Work packages could include surfacing works, structures works, technology related works, and general highway improvements across the whole of the Highways Agency motorway and trunk road network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive of Costain, commented:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“We are delighted with these additional appointments from existing customers, which demonstrate the ongoing success of the implementation of our ‘Choosing Costain’ strategy: providing a broader service offering to the major customers who are making significant investment in the UK’s national infrastructure needs.”</strong></em></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>6 November 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, the engineering solutions provider, today issues its Interim Management Statement covering the period from 1 July 2012 to the current date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Overview </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following its strong performance in the first half of 2012, the Group is continuing to perform well, in line with the Board's expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group’s strategy is to focus its resources on meeting the integrated service requirements of major customers, whose spending plans are underpinned by national needs, regulatory commitments or essential maintenance requirements and who are continuing to invest significantly in those requirements. The Group’s strong relationships with its customers are underlined by the fact that over 90% of the Group’s forward order book is made up of repeat orders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the period the Group has secured further contract awards and extensions including an appointment by Magnox to a framework contract worth around £288 million over a ten year period for the delivery of construction, infrastructure and maintenance projects across all ten sites operated by Magnox on behalf of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain continues to expand its support service related activities, both organically and by benefitting from the capabilities secured through the acquisition of two businesses last year. Currently 28% of revenues secured for 2012 comprise support service activities and this is expected to continue to grow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Order book</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group’s forward order book currently stands at £2.4 billion. As well as including over £650 million of revenues secured for 2013 the order book also provides good long-term visibility with circa £1.6 billion of revenues secured for 2014 and beyond, the balance of the order book being for the remainder of 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group has also maintained a strong preferred bidder position of c. £400 million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The overall level of tendering activity across the Group's targeted markets remains high.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Financial position</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There has been no material change in the robust financial status of the Group, which continues to have a strong net cash position and no significant borrowings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Outlook</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is meeting the integrated service requirements of major customers, who are continuing to invest in essential infrastructure projects. Despite the on-going challenging economic conditions, Costain remains on course to deliver a result for the year in line with the Board's expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">6 November 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Enquiries:</p>
<p>Costain Tel: 01628 842 444<br />Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive <br />Tony Bickerstaff, Finance Director <br />Graham Read, Communications Director <br /> <br />College Hill Tel: 020 7457 2020<br />Mark Garraway <br />Helen Tarbet </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>6 November 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A week-long focus on energy awareness across Costain starts on November 12, as the Group pursues its target of cutting its CO₂ emissions by 55% by the end of the decade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An extensive programme of toolbox talks, staff briefings and appointment of energy champions to co-ordinate the campaign on projects and within the offices throughout the business will be backed up by promotional material and themed communication. All of this has the aim of encouraging staff to cut emissions, reduce environmental impact and save costs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The various tools for the week have been developed and collated by Graduate Environmental Advisor, Claire Baker. “She’s done a fine job,” said Group Environmental  Manager, Amy Shuffleton. “It’s a very comprehensive package of material to support our environmental aims.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The programme comes after a series of trials in the spring at Maidenhead, Manchester and a couple of other major projects; amendments and refinements were then made before its Group-wide launch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The idea is to engage everyone in the topic of climate change,” said Amy.  “We give people the information on how to cut the amount of energy they use and we hope it will change their behaviour.“</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The theme is ‘Save it by switching off’; “The idea is not only to reduce the impact on the environment and its associated costs from Costain’s point of view but to give people an opportunity to take the ideas home with them,” she added. Energy consumption will be monitored both during Energy Awareness Week and the preceding seven days to check the impact the events have had on consumption.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain also plans to engage its supply chain and, where appropriate, its customers, in the process.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>5 November 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Costain Environmental Services technician has won the British Drilling Association’s (BDA) Apprentice of the Year award.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bourne End-based Technician Drilling Operator, Antonio Vieira, picked up the winner’s trophy at the BDA’s annual dinner at Harrogate. The BDA is a trade association with over 100 member companies that promotes excellence, professional standards and safety in all forms of onshore drilling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Antonio, who operates a drilling machine at sites around the country, completed a two-year apprenticeship in May, gaining an NVQ Level 2. The apprenticeship consists of normal working interspersed with a series of week-long courses on subjects such as drilling techniques, soil and rock logging, coring, sample collection and management, health and safety, grouting and anchoring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He learned of his award from Geotechnical Manager, Wilton Bennett, a couple of weeks before the award.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Antonio’s very hard-working,” said Wilton. “Regardless of what the job is, he’s very willing to just get on with it.” Wilton also likes the fact that Antonio thinks about what he’s doing, rather than simply following instructions: “He’ll voice his opinion, which is a good thing. He’ll ask questions and make suggestions.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His award came as a surprise to Wilton. “We weren’t aware there was an award. I got a phone call saying ‘He’s been selected.’ I think the BDA was very pleased with his attitude and his interest in the programme.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It was fantastic,” said Antonio of the award ceremony. “It was like getting a Christmas present.” He is now lead driller on a transportable drilling machine that can penetrate 10 metres below the surface.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Antonio was the most outstanding apprentice,” said John Grainger, chairman of the BDA, which arranged the training course. His award included him becoming the first recipient of the Derek Oakes Trophy. Oakes was one of the founders of the BDA in 1976.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">31 October 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Olympic Rower, Zac Purchase, returned to his home town recently to help officially launch the all-new Costain backed Tewkesbury Rowing Club.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tewkesbury School pupils and staff celebrated the launch of their first boats following a mammoth fund-raising effort, led by an initial donation of £4,000 from Costain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain was approached while constructing the flood defence barriers at the Mythe Water Treatment Works. After hearing from the young people of the devastating effects on their homes of the 2007 floods, the Company wanted to help re-connect the youth of the town back to the river in a fun and positive way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Programme Manager, Simon Roberts, said: “We are really delighted to see that the club’s fundraising efforts have delivered these wonderful boats. We are sure that the pupils and staff will really enjoy them and wish the club every success for the future.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Head of rowing at the school, Charlie Gardiner, hosted the event which was attended by various civic dignitaries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said that 80 youngsters had already taken part in club activities, many of whom had been inspired by Zac’s Olympic efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The club currently has a squad of 25 members, but with inquiries pouring in the pressure is on to increase resources. New money has been awarded to the club by the NHS, Severn Vale Housing Association and Active Gloucestershire to help it grow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Charlie said: “With this money, we have been able to employ a professional head coach for this year who trained juniors at Gloucester and went on to become Olympians. We also plan to purchase more equipment, including coaching launches and more racing boats to cope with the growth of the club.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">30 October 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain team working on the Dwr Cymru Welsh Water Framework is celebrating after being presented with the ‘Highly Commended Award’ at the sixth annual Welsh Water Occupational Health and Safety Excellence Awards ceremony held at the Liberty Stadium, in Swansea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a prize for winning the ‘Highly Commended Award’, the team was given £1,000 to donate to a local charity. The team was asked to nominate local causes and it was decided that the prize would be shared between two local charities, Wales Air Ambulance and Clwyd Special Riding School (CSRS), who each received a cheque for £500.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jane Russell, Centre Manager at CSRS, said: “Our links with local businesses such as Costain are very special to us and it is only with continued support such as this that we are able to make such a difference by providing riding, carriage driving, equestrian vaulting and specialist physiotherapy using a horse, to more than 200 people every week – of all ages and with all additional needs. Sponsorship of our workforce is an enormous financial help to us and covers the day to day upkeep costs, including routine veterinary expenses and the six weekly shoeing costs and we are very grateful for the ongoing help.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Madden, Costain Framework Director, said: “The Welsh Water Costain team is delighted to be recognised, once again, by Welsh Water for our commitment to health and safety. It gave me great pleasure to be able to meet and present cheques to Lady Gladstone, from Clwyd Special Riding Centre, and Captain Martin Darlington, from Wales Air Ambulance. We hope we are able to provide more support to such worthwhile causes in the future.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">29 October 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Graduate Engineer, Ben Howard, is back at Costain after taking a nine month unpaid sabbatical to compete as a professional athlete on the European circuit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ben competed in the multi-discipline sport of Triathlon where athletes compete for honours in three continuous events – a swim, a cycle race and then a lung-bursting run to the finish. Ben took part in seven races across the continent, including Portugal, Estonia, Mallorca and France, and secured a top-10 finish in all but one race with two 2nd and one 3rd place podium finishes. He also notched up two wins on the domestic circuit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Distances vary depending on the competition. In the 2011 season, Ben covered distances that you would normally see in the Olympics - a 1500m swim, a 40km cycle race and 10km run. However, on his sabbatical, Ben upped his game to compete in middle-distance racing which comprises a 1900m swim, a 90km cycle race and a 21km, or a half marathon, run.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain has been very understanding and supportive about my ambition to compete and I’m deeply grateful for the opportunities that I’ve had, not only for being able to go away and compete but also to come back and resume my career,” said Ben.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ben was sponsored by the Company through university and joined Costain full time as a Graduate Engineer in 2010 to work on the 4Delivery Brighton &amp; Hove project at Peacehaven a mere month after winning the World Amateur Triathlon Championships in Budapest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ben is now back at Costain working on the London Bridge Redevelopment Project, which he says is a “fantastic project with incredible opportunities.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I enjoyed the experience but there are only a few triathletes at the top level that can make a living out of the sport while the rest are struggling to get by. I managed to get support from sponsors that just about recovered the cost of my kit and race entries, while my race winnings covered my other costs,” said Ben.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">25 October 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Northern Ireland Minister for Regional Development, Danny Kennedy MLA, has signalled the start of the A8 Belfast to Larne Dualling (a Costain joint venture project) by cutting the first sod of the £102 million scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Minister said: “These works, which will take 34 months to complete, are of significant importance to the economic development of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Upgrading the A8 to dual carriageway will help grow the local economy and contribute to the wider economic development in Northern Ireland, both in the short term and in the long term. It will also help with the development of the Port of Larne, which is the second largest Port in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“As part of the Trans European Network, the A8 is a strategically significant European route, which provides an important East-West link, between Northern Ireland and Scotland, via the Port of Larne.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The scheme involves upgrading 14.4km of the existing A8, between Coleman’s Corner Roundabout and Ballyrickard Road, to dual carriageway standard, and incorporates a new roundabout at Shane’s Hill Road, as well as a number of grade-separated junctions, bridges and left-in left-out junctions along the scheme, which will provide access to the new road and local access.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The scheme seeks to improve journey times for this stretch of the A8 and will help remove the issues associated with platooning of traffic, thus reducing driver frustration and improving the safety performance of the route for all road users.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction of the scheme by the joint venture of Lagan, Ferrovial and Costain, started in August this year with the works expected to be completed in spring 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr Kennedy continued: “Site works are currently ongoing which include the erection of temporary fencing, archaeology digs, culvert installation and other enabling works along the scheme.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is estimated that 55,000 tonnes of concrete, 1,300 tonnes of steel reinforcement and 310,000 tonnes of bituminous material will be used for the scheme which will lead to an increase in demand for local suppliers of construction material.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finally the Minister congratulated all those involved in reaching this important milestone for the Department and wished them all the success during the works and good progress to the completion of the works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said: “I would like to wish the delivery team, including Lagan, Ferrovial, Costain joint venture, its designer URS, its sub-contractors, as well as my Department’s Roads Service and its consultants ARUP, every success during scheme construction. I look forward to the completion of the scheme in Spring 2015. I have no doubt this scheme will be of significant benefit to both strategic traffic and other road users in the local community.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>22 October 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A major milestone in the construction of the Costain project Harbour Way* has taken place with the demolition of Cefn Gwrgan Bridge, in Port Talbot. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The old bridge, which had been the main entrance into the Tata Steelworks for over 60 years, was demolished to make way for a new 150m long road-over-rail bridge that forms an integral part of Harbour Way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The £107m project is jointly funded by the Welsh Assembly Government and the European Regional Development Fund.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before demolition could begin, temporary reinforced earth ramps and walls had to be constructed to divert traffic over the partially completed new bridge and then onto a completed section of Harbour Way to Tata’s newly constructed main entrance, ensuring uninterrupted access to the steelworks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The controlled demolition of the old bridge had to be meticulously planned due to its crossing of the Swansea to Paddington mainline railway and having a number of strategic services which feed the steelworks underslung from its deck.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially the parapets were removed using burning equipment and folded back by excavators with selector grabs. Once crash mats were laid out, the cantilevers and the main deck of the bridge were predominately removed using excavators with multi-tool attachments. Where more sensitive techniques were required, deck sections were cut out using wire-saws and then lifted out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the final weekend rest cuts were introduced into the remaining steel portals and lifted out sequentially using a pair of mobile cranes. Once the last of the bridge impact blocks were wire-sawed and removed, the track was handed back to Network Rail four hours early, utilising only three out of the four planned disruptive rail possessions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain engaged in a public consultation programme to keep local residents informed about the demolition work schedule.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Skentelbery, Costain’s Project Manager said: “The successful demolition of Cefn Gwrgan Bridge is a major milestone in the construction of Harbour Way. It means that we remain on target to complete the project on time by the autumn of 2013.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">22 October 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Severn Trent Costain (STC) has announced that major UK dairy, First Milk, is to become the first business customer to switch water supplier since the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) altered the regulations to allow more businesses to be able to choose their water supplier.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Until recently only businesses that used more than fifty megalitres of water a year, equal to 20 Olympic sized swimming pools, could switch from their existing water supplier to a new one. The threshold has now been reduced to just five megalitres of water, equivalent to two Olympic sized swimming pools, which has substantially increased the number of businesses that are able to choose their water supplier from just 2,200 to 26,000 businesses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Severn Trent Costain, a joint venture that combines the skills and experience of Severn Trent Services, one of the world’s leading suppliers of water and wastewater solutions, and Costain the UK’s leading engineering solutions provider, has signed up First Milk in a deal that will see STC supply, manage and monitor its water across six major sites in England, Wales and Scotland involving over 600 million litres of water per year. The new arrangement builds on an ongoing successful relationship with First Milk. The two organisations have already been working together to improve asset performance, deriving ongoing savings from day-to-day operational efficiencies and delivering plant optimisation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contract underlines Severn Trent Costain’s focus on providing customers with the benefits of water competition as the water retail market moves to full opening in 2017. Managing Director, Wayne Earp said: “The competitive market is clearly now a reality and will drive innovation in the water industry. STC are focussed on taking the lead in creating enhanced services for customers, reducing their costs and making more efficient use of resources.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">STC will be installing state-of-the-art monitoring equipment at all of the six First Milk sites.  Coupled with STC’s expertise this will enable First Milk to develop a detailed understanding of its water usage, as well as options for how it can become more efficient.  First Milk has recently set out its sustainability objectives within its first Sustainability Report, published October 2012. There are five specific programme areas within First Milk’s sustainability policy and improving the efficiency of water use at its sites, is a key objective within the ‘Reduce, Renew, Recycle’ pillar supporting their drive towards renewable energy, zero waste and recovered water use throughout the supply chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paul Rowe, First Milk Manufacturing Director, commented: “Being able to get a closer handle on our water usage is not just beneficial to our business, but to any business. We believe that this new contract with Severn Trent Costain will help us in our quest to meet some of the sustainability targets we have set ourselves as a business, and help prepare us for some of the short and long term challenges facing our industry.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">17 October 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Costain-Skanska JV recently opened its doors to give members of the general public a rare view of Europe’s largest infrastructure project, Crossrail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Almost 350 people attended the 'Open House' event  with 14 tours conducted by Crossrail, Costain Skanska JV, Bechtel and BFK.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crossrail Bond Street opened its doors at 75 Davies Street so that stakeholders could hear a short factual presentation on the entire scheme and the Bond Street project. Visitors were then given the opportunity to view the work being done by CSJV and BFK at the Western and Eastern Ticket Halls.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Claire Carr and James Moloney volunteered to help members of the public understand the size, scale and technical ingenuity of the overall project, which will run from Maidenhead and Heathrow in the west, through twin-bore 21 km tunnels under central London, before forking at Stepney Green for Shenfield near Brentwood and Abbey Wood in southeast London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Everyone concerned had a brilliant day and it was great to be able to give members of the public a behind-the-scenes view of how the project is coming together and where Bond Street fits into the overall scheme. It was also a nice reminder for everyone working on Bond Street that we are all part of an amazing project,” said Claire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once completed, the 118 kilometre high frequency rail route will have 37 stations including seven new underground stations at Paddington, Bond Street, Tottenham Court Road, Farringdon, Liverpool Street, Whitechapel and Canary Wharf.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Services for the £14.8 billion project are due to commence in 2018.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">15 October 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Matt Blackwell has picked up an award from COMIT Projects Ltd for the Company’s contribution to utilising mobile information technology in the UK construction workplace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Matt accepted the Investment in New Solutions Award in recognition of Costain’s use of Augmented Reality (AR) technology on the London Bridge Redevelopment Project for Network Rail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COMIT Projects Ltd promotes the use of mobile technology in the UK construction industry by spreading best practice, promoting new developments and facilitating understanding between technology providers and construction companies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are delighted to have won this award which recognises Costain’s ongoing commitment to delivering innovative solutions to construction operatives. Harnessing the best available technology, like Augmented Reality, helps us to gather the best information in order to get the job done as effectively as possible,” said Matt, Costain’s Group BIM Manager.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Augmented Reality takes a real-world environment, such as a construction project, and augments it with computer-generated sensory input such as sound, video, graphics or GPS data. Construction data from the project can be rendered onto a screen to build up an image of the finished project while also highlighting any potential problems in the construction process. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AR is a component of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and a process for managing construction data which enables engineers to co-ordinate 3D models, analyse geometry, spatial relationships and geographic information, like major utilities, which can potentially impede the construction process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has worked closely with COMIT Projects Ltd to refine the use of mobile technology in the construction work place and has used BIM on its projects for a number of years, most notably on Junction 12 of the M1, the Bond Street Underground Station Upgrade, Liverpool Wastewater Treatment Works and various Crossrail projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company is co-sponsoring the Building Information Mobility Conference in London on November 15, where Matt will be presenting with representatives from Network Rail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Matt has also been appointed as Chairman of COMIT’s BIM for Mobility Group which has been tasked with investigating the innovative use of mobile technology within construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Investment in New Solutions Award is for the team’s work at London Bridge but also in recognition of Costain’s overall contribution to promoting innovation and using mobile technology in the construction work place. Getting information to construction operatives in the field and then getting it back into the system for analysis is vital for the success of any construction project,” said Neill Pawsey, the Programme Director at COMIT Projects Ltd.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tim Embley, Costain’s Group Innovation and Knowledge Manager, added: “COMIT Projects Ltd provides an excellent network for Costain to collaborate with member organisations to develop solutions to solve industry challenges. These solutions range from services that enable our engineers to access information in the field via cloud computing to remote monitoring of assets where we are able to provide cost effective services to our customers.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The C330 Royal Oak Portal contract in west London, for which a Costain Skanska joint venture (CSJV) was the contractor, has won Crossrail’s first ‘Whole Project Award’ under the CEEQUAL scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CEEQUAL is the assessment and awards scheme for improving sustainability in civil engineering and the public realm. It aims to demonstrate the commitment of the civil engineering industry to environmental quality and social performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crossrail had already been awarded ‘Excellent’ status under the CEEQUAL scheme for individual aspects of the contract.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CSJV Project Manager, Dr Vicknayson Thevendran, said examples of sustainability on the project included recycling aggregates for temporary and permanent works, for example using rainwater for the wheel-wash for vehicles leaving the site and solar panels to power monitoring equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“For us it was business as usual, as it was in line with Costain’s Corporate Social Responsibility policy. The fact that we achieved an Excellent Award at such an early stage of the Crossrail project shows the potential this project has in making London a better place.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">8 October 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Steve Hampson has been picked to play in a charity rugby match at the Emirates Dubai 7s rugby tournament to raise money for Jack Johnson who has Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Steve, a former Wigan Warriors and Great Britain rugby league player, now works as an Assistant SHE Advisor for Costain’s GCA joint venture on behalf of water company, United Utilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Capped 12 times for his country, Steve played at fullback for Wigan, the same club as Jack’s father, Andy. Other members of the 'Joining Jack' charity team include former England and Great Britain internationals Jason Robinson, Sean Long, Kris Radlinski and Adrian Morley.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The charity match, which is for participants over the age of 35, will take place at the Dubai Sevens ground between November 29th and December 1st 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Johnsons are very close to everybody’s heart because Andy played rugby at Wigan and rugby league is very much a family sport. More needs to be done to raise people’s awareness of the DMD condition which affects one in 3,500 boys worldwide, so we’re all quite looking forward to knocking lumps out of each other for a very worthwhile cause,” said Steve.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Four-year old Jack was diagnosed with DMD in 2011. DMD is the most common form of muscular dystrophy and is caused by a faulty dystrophin gene. That means the body doesn’t produce dystrophin, a protein that helps protect muscles. Without it, muscle fibres start to break down and are replaced by fibrous and fatty tissue, causing the muscle to weaken.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The condition affects males in particular because the faulty gene is passed on unwittingly by the mother through her X chromosome, which is where the dystrophin gene is carried.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Girls aren’t usually affected because they have two X chromosomes, and the X chromosome that is normal prevents them from developing the condition. But boys have only one X chromosome.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Around 20,000 new cases reported each year in the developed world. For more information about the condition and the charity event, please visit:</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">4 October 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The final stage of work on a new transfer deck at Reading Station is now underway, after what is believed to have been Great Western rail region’s first jacking into position of such a structure over a live railway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The transfer deck, part of Network Rail’s £80million upgrade of the busy Berkshire station, will replace the existing passenger bridge across the tracks, providing considerably enhanced capacity and escalators down to the platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second section of the bridge was constructed beside the station then moved into position over five nights in the period between the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The first section was launched before the Olympics got underway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leading the team of around 30 personnel behind the bridge slide was Site Agent, Dave Forbes, who revealed that it took two nights to slide the second bridge section 18 metres over the tracks…then a further three nights to lower it just 100mm into its final position.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 1100-tonne section was lowered 25mm at a time in a series of steps to ensure it fitted exactly onto its bearings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“A lot of surveying was necessary, together with a lot of work to get the bearings into the right position and get the section exactly level,” he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“There were no real problems during the slide. This was a Great Western ‘first’ in that it was carried out  over an operational railway and wasn’t done in possession [when rail services are suspended]. This demonstrated both Network Rail and First Great Western’s confidence in the team after the earlier bridge slide,” commented Dave.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stage three of the deck is now being built in situ, between the two sections. “From a structural point of view, we’re working towards completion at the end of October,” said Dave. “For fit-out and completion, we’re looking at early February 2013, with the bridge commissioned and open to the public by late March.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">2 October 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has officially opened its Supply Chain Academy, a new initiative that aims to support and develop small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company welcomed 15 suppliers on September 3rd to attend the first of 20 modules covering business administration, commercial and financial best practice, insurance, health &amp; safety, behavioural safety and quality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Academy has been launched to align the Company’s supply chain partners with the high standard of training and development adopted across the Group. The initiative is also in line with Costain Cares, the Company’s vision to build a longer-term sustainable business that creates economic, environmental and social value.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company plans to hold two intakes per year, with the first intake due to finish in mid-December and the second intake expected to arrive in January 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We take supply chain management relationships with our suppliers very seriously and this is a great opportunity for us to be able to give the organisations that we work with the benefit of our award winning training programmes. Over a three-month period the suppliers will pass through a structured programme of learning and development. The training will be provided free of charge and will hopefully allow them to emerge stronger, better equipped and a more robust organisation,” said Richard Howell, Costain’s Head of Supply Chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Three of the modules will be delivered by Costain’s supply chain partners NG Bailey, the UK’s leading independent engineering, IT and facilities services business, and KPMG, the professional services firm.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The response so far has been positive. Rowland Kendrick-Thomas, Director at Anglewest Ltd, a commercial scaffolding contractor, said: “We want to be part of this programme because we see it as part of a continual improvement in our policies and procedures and the professional development of our staff.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Will Hart, Director of Taylor Hart Ltd, a specialist ceiling and partitions contractor, said: “We are always looking to increase our competency levels in all areas of our business. We are pleased to be part of an initiative that helps us align ourselves more closely to our customers and their working cultures. This can only be beneficial to the customer and our supply chain partners.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jason Smith, Framework Director for Cema Ltd, an electrical engineering company based in Nottingham, said: “We at Cema Ltd strongly believe in the continued personal development of our staff. Costain’s ‘Supply Chain Academy’ aligns perfectly with our drive for continuous improvement in all areas of our business.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>25 September 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Graduate Engineer’s dedication to promoting the construction industry has been rewarded after he scooped a national award.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rory Jones, a Costain graduate who works on the Costain Dwr Cymru Welsh Water Framework recently won the North Wales CITB- ConstructionSkills Construction Ambassador of the Year Award 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rory received the title for his commitment to inspiring North Wales’ young learners to explore a career in the construction and built environment sector. He has gone into primary and secondary schools to give presentations about opportunities in the industry, undertaken mock interviews with students who wish to undertake a career in the Construction Industry and mentored two summer placement engineers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rory said: “This award is recognition of the work that Costain is doing to promote construction as a career. It is also a personal milestone for me and I am honoured to have been chosen as the 2012 recipient, especially when considering the calibre of the other finalists." </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The country is currently going through a tough financial period and our industry is without a doubt suffering! As a consequence, we are currently losing more and more professional people from our industry to overseas projects; therefore it’s more important now than ever, to secure the skills base we need in order to be prepared for future growth within our industry.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Emrys Roberts of CITB-ConstructionSkills Wales said: "We are delighted to have been able to celebrate Rory's success as Construction Ambassador of the Year. Rory’s enthusiasm and pro-active, innovative approach to developing his role as a Construction Ambassador was the deciding factor.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Madden, Costain Framework Director said: ”Rory is a young Costain engineer with an exciting career ahead of him and it is to his credit that he has devoted some of his personal time and resources to encouraging schoolchildren to follow him into the Construction Industry.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">24 September 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain's charity fund at the Sellafield Site in West Cumbria, has successfully supported its fifth application since inception last year - its biggest grant application to date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Managed by the Cumbria Community Foundation, the Costain Fund provides grants to support projects that help improve the lives of people in West Cumbria by raising their aspirations and achievements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mirehouse Community Centre was awarded £2,500 from the fund to help subsidise the cost of activities for local residents and cover the overheads of the current facility. The centre is at the heart of the community and provides a great social hub for all generations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking on behalf of the committee, Keith Gaunt said: "The Mirehouse Residents Group would like to thank Costain for their fantastic generosity; this will be a massive boost to the community, and the implementation of the Groups Action Plan. We look forward to meeting again in the future to show the fruition of these plans and evidence that the funding has been well invested."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Neil Grosset, Project Manager for Costain said: "It was a great pleasure to meet Keith, members of the committee and the local residents. The facilities are fantastic. I was really honoured to be able to present our biggest donation to date to the Community Centre. They are providing a vital service for residents who otherwise wouldn't leave their homes."</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>20 September 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, in joint venture with HOCHTIEF and Arup, has received funding from the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) and the Technology Strategy Board’s (TSB) Offshore Wind Components Technologies Scheme to carry out research on the design and construction of concrete gravity foundations for large offshore wind turbines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wholly-owned joint venture company, GRAVITAS Offshore Ltd, has secured a £556,250 grant to demonstrate the benefits of the foundation technique. Concrete gravity foundations are expected to play a key part in delivering the next round in wind farm developments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ongoing work is designed to help demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of this approach against foundation technologies adopted for offshore wind systems in the UK. The GRAVITAS project will also help to develop reliable standards for concrete offshore wind foundations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Greg Barker, the Energy and Climate Change Minister, said: “This investment from DECC will help GRAVITAS Offshore Ltd develop and demonstrate the benefits of its innovative turbine foundation design, cutting costs for offshore wind and helping it enter the growing green market place.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GRAVITAS Offshore has also reached an advanced stage to commit to the construction of a demonstrator foundation for deployment in UK waters within the next two years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That means GRAVITAS Offshore can further engage with the supply chain to optimise construction and implementation and by doing so reinforce the cost-effectiveness and deliverability of UK offshore wind energy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The endorsement of our solution by DECC is an excellent result for the team as offshore wind is a cornerstone of the UK energy market reform. The UK renewable energy roadmap indicates a central range of up to 18GW for the deployment of offshore wind by 2020 and our solution will be instrumental in meeting these aspirations,” said Colin Duff, Costain’s Director of Renewables.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">11 September 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain and its partners have handed over four more secondary schools to the London Borough of Lewisham, as well as a significant new build phase of a fifth school on schedule.  On the first day of the September term pupils were welcomed into their new or refurbished premises.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s involvement in the successful Building Schools for the Future programme in the borough is now nearing its end. It is currently developing the design of Sydenham Girls’ College, with construction work programmed to start in early 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Three of the latest schools to be handed over, Bonus Pastor Catholic College, Deptford Green and Prendergast Vale College, are brand-new and have been delivered through the Private Finance Initiative by Lewisham Schools for the Future, a consortium that includes Costain and Babcock International.  Design and construction was undertaken by Costain, whilst the facilities management and ICT services are being provided by Babcock. Together, the schools provide modern, purpose-built accommodation for 2050 pupils.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, as design and build contractor, has also completed Addey &amp; Stanhope School, and a further two phases of Prendergast Hilly Fields College. These have both new-build and refurbished elements and are welcoming 1420 pupils into the new facilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the pupils move in, Phase II work at the four sites will continue, to redevelop old buildings or demolish them in order to provide playing fields or multi-games areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Lewisham Schools for the Future Local Education Partnership has been working with Lewisham since 2007 to improve and renew the borough’s schools estate. This most recent handover brings the total number of pupils benefitting from new or refurbished schools to 6725.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alistair Handford, Costain’s Director of Investments, said: "Costain is delighted to have worked with the London Borough of Lewisham to provide a modern and exciting environment for learning for the young people of Lewisham."</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>10 September 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is using Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology at London Bridge to help meet the challenges of working on one of the country’s biggest rail redevelopment projects, but it will also provide valuable data for maintaining the asset in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Beth Willoughby understands the importance of using BIM on large complex projects having worked on projects such as the Bond Street Station Upgrade for London Underground.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The London Bridge Redevelopment project is part of a programme of works for Network Rail that will increase the frequency of trains running through London on the busy Thameslink route and will involve the construction of a new concourse at street level, with entrances on Tooley Street and St Thomas Street.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Scheduled for completion in 2018, the project will see through-station passenger capacity rise to 90 million people a year from 55 million currently.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beth is a Section Manager on the London Bridge project and was recently shortlisted for the prestigious 2013 James Rennie Medal Award which is awarded to the best Chartered Professional Review candidate by the Institution of Civil Engineers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The successful implementation of BIM could well be crucial to the overall success of the project. BIM can highlight potential issues and provide solutions to construction problems by testing the design of an asset.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“With BIM and 3D modelling we can collate large volumes of information for the asset owner and then deliver it in a usable format rather than capturing and documenting information at the end of a project. Therefore, one of the biggest benefits for the customer is in the delivery on-site and the on-going management of the asset once the project is handed over to the customer,” said Beth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BIM and 3D modelling allows engineers to check for structural, architectural and building services clashes within existing structures. It also analyses geometry, spatial relationships and geographic information, like major utilities, that can impede the construction process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another benefit of BIM is that it allows for closer integration and communication across the supply chain, particularly through project-wide access to the latest project information. That means documents and plans can be viewed by all concerned, without the need to carry around drawings, which also reduces the reliance on printed material being taken on-site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beth worked closely with her project colleagues at Network Rail to ensure full engagement with the customer to deliver maximum benefits to the project, and she investigated various Field BIM solutions to ensure that design information could be delivered to the site via a 3D model.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with Costain’s Group BIM Manager, Matt Blackwell, Beth identified potential suppliers and partners to help develop the best solution, not only for the project but also for Network Rail once the project is completed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Any issues that arise can be managed through the tool for supply chain management, which means resources can be allocated as soon as a problem is found, rather than being raised back at the office. Field BIM tools can be extended further for tracking materials, either through QR Codes or RFID (Radio Frequency ID) tags, or for logistics and site management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting, Clive Loosemore, the Project Director at London Bridge, said: “Costain brings a highly skilled team to London Bridge that, like Beth, possess valuable experience of station redevelopment as well as using the latest technology, like BIM, to help deliver the project successfully.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">6 September 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Magnox has awarded a framework contract worth around £288 million for the delivery of construction, infrastructure and maintenance projects across all 10 sites which are operated by Magnox on behalf of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The framework is worth approximately £30m per annum for up to ten years: an initial five years with the option to extend for a further five years by mutual agreement amongst the parties. Costain is one of two companies on the framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project work which Costain will deliver includes: the design, construction and maintenance of permanent buildings and structures, infrastructure maintenance and extension works incorporating construction, civil engineering structures and ground works projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This framework contract builds on the work Costain is already carrying out for Magnox. In June 2011 the Group announced that, as part of a joint venture with AMEC and Jacobs Engineering Group Inc, it had been included on a framework to retrieve and process both wet and solid intermediate level radioactive waste across all the Magnox sites in the UK.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive of Costain, commented:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“Construction, infrastructure and maintenance will form a major part of the work to deliver Magnox sites into a state of care and maintenance. Inclusion on this framework is testament to our growing reputation for providing specialised engineering solutions to customers and industry sectors which have highly complex requirements.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“The contract award also demonstrates the ongoing success of the implementation of our ‘Choosing Costain’ strategy: providing a broader service offering to blue chip customers who are making significant investment in the UK’s national infrastructure needs.”</strong></em></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">5 September 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Promanex, Costain’s support services division, is undertaking the final phase of an innovative maintenance project at Ratcliffe-on-Soar power station in Nottinghamshire for E.ON, one of the UK’s leading power and gas companies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Promanex won the contract through a competitive tender by demonstrating the most effective technical and commercial solution and has already overhauled four of its concrete natural draught hyperbolic cooling towers as part of the first phase of this major environmental upgrade project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second tranche of work - to help maintain the four remaining cooling towers - started in 2011 and will be completed during an outage window in 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Standing at 115 meters high, the cooling towers pose significant challenges for anyone working on them and the team had to devise a number of innovative and cost effective solutions to get the job done, whilst adhering to the highest level of health and safety.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project included the replacement of the old heavily silted pack and supports with a new improved design cooling surface as well as the removal of the old timber drift eliminators and supports with modern PVC blade type equivalents and the removal and redesign.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team built a manufacturing facility on the site for the fabrication of the modular film pack. In total, approximately 750,000 separate corrugated PVC sheets were assembled using purpose built innovative machinery. The on-site manufacturing solution provided by Promanex ensured a high quality output and removed costly and carbon negative logistical/haulage options concerned with the transportation of bulk pack modules.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each tower was re-fitted with approximately 10,000m3 of plastic modular low fouling film pack which reduced the risk of fouling while also increasing performance and efficiency and reducing energy consumption.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Health and safety has been a key component of the project. The team installed additional permanent access ladders and self-closing gates within the towers which have significantly improved access for on-going maintenance. This initiative has helped to lower the health and safety risk, reduce costs and increase access to ensure maximum asset protection.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“All personnel working on the project embraced both the required safety culture and the high standards expected from Promanex and the customer. We worked in unison with E.ON’s management team to make the project a safe place of work by adopting initiatives such as SAM (Save A Mate) and Stop the Drop, which was crucial during the high-risk working at height phase of the project as it involved removing the pack media from inside the cooling tower,” said Rob Flinn, Promanex’s Water Services Director.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">4 September 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Personnel at sites around the Severn Trent Water framework contract have been receiving the benefit of visits from the British Heart Foundation (BHF) and Macmillan Cancer Nurses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past three years, 12 people with an average age of just 50 have died of heart attacks or strokes on Costain sites around the UK.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With this tragic toll in mind Graduate SHE Advisor, Laura Colleran, invited the BHF’s Ann Persson to visit four sites – Frankley, Minworth, Finham and Longbridge – to offer advice on staying healthy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ann gave a presentation on how minor changes to lifestyle could significantly reduce the risk of heart disease.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Ann was delighted to get involved with Costain to increase the awareness of heart health for all employees on our sites,” said Laura. “The feedback from the sites was positive and it was encouraging to see them all getting involved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Hopefully it will be a relationship Costain can further develop with the BHF and introduce to sites company-wide.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ann echoed Laura's comments: “It was a pleasure delivering the sessions as staff were keen on picking up information about symptoms of heart attacks, what to do if someone has a heart attack and how to prevent it.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, Macmillan nurses visited Frankley to raise awareness of skin cancer among staff  and conducted private, one-to-one sessions with anyone who had specific concerns. The occasion was an ideal opportunity also to check site staff’s blood pressure and 38 people took up the offer. Anyone above the recommended level was given advice on lifestyle changes that could help their health.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Separately, Frankley is celebrating achieving ‘Very Good Site’ status under the Considerate Constructors Scheme (CCS). A first visit by CCS inspectors ranked site appearance, approach to health and safety plus adhering to CCS as just short of ‘exceptional’.</li>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>30 August 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of Costain’s sponsored students has pushed forward her career prospects through her involvement at the inaugural Young Surveyors’ Conference held by the Fédération Internationale de Géomètres (FIG).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Carmen Tong attended the two-day event in Rome, which saw 120 young surveyors from 40 countries meet to network, improve awareness and encourage involvement in the profession, which is something of a ‘Cinderella speciality’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The two days were filled with presentations and debates on topics such as how young surveyors could influence the future of the profession. A recurring theme was the lack of young people entering surveying due to its low profile both generally and at schools, which do not push surveying as a career option.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Carmen, who is due to graduate next year from the University of East London with a BSc Honours in civil engineering, surveying and mapping sciences, has been sponsored by Costain since she began the course in 2010.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain currently sponsors around 75 students, who take up secondments at its sites and spend a year with the Company as part of their degree courses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last summer, Carmen worked on the M1 Junction 10-13 widening project and this year will be employed on the revitalisation of London Bridge station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We have an award winning graduate recruitment programme for sponsored students,” said Group Innovation Manager Tim Embley. “Anyone can apply but we look for certain credentials – not just academic ability but also personal qualities. We’re looking for a balanced individual with a range of capabilities to respond to our customer’s requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“In terms of our graduates this year, we’re very much focusing on developing their personal strengths.  This means developing talent that supports the transformation of the business to be a leading engineering solutions provider. Carmen has demonstrated her strengths by engaging and promoting Costain at this conference being an ambassador for the industry and Costain.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The initial benefit from the conference was really the networking side,” said Carmen, “together with getting together to exchange news and views.” She and her international colleagues are considering staging a European young surveyors’ conference next year.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>28 August 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s extensive operations at London Heathrow Airport have recorded a year without any lost time accidents (LTAs).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Heathrow remains the world’s busiest airport in terms of the number of international passengers.  Ensuring that health and safety standards are kept at high levels is Costain’s focus whilst managing the complexities of having to manoeuvre around arriving and departing aircraft, plus some 80,000 airport personnel, passengers and their vehicles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the past year, Costain has tackled a multitude of projects at Heathrow, ranging from the demolition of old buildings and renewing baggage handling facilities to replacing boilers and upgrading and resurfacing perimeter roads.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Operations Director, Joe Kemm commented: “To not have a single RIDDOR incident and a year without an LTA is a remarkable achievement for the team, especially when you consider the number of separate sites that have been in operation, the nature of the construction and commissioning activities and the diverse engineering project requirements that have been carried out.  I am very proud of the efforts that have been put in by all members of the team in ensuring that everyone went home safely at the end of their shift throughout the year.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’ve worked in every one of the terminals except Terminal 2, which is currently being rebuilt,” said Costain’s SHE Manager at Heathrow, Neal Kennedy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At any given time, Costain has a workforce of around 160 people there, often working unsocial hours in order not to disrupt the airport’s work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The way we have to work is not like a normal construction site with hoardings erected permanently around the job,” said Kennedy. “A lot of ours are night jobs that start at 11pm when the airport is closing and end at 4am, before it re-opens. We have to be almost invisible during the day.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He put the lack of LTAs over the past year down to a multi-layered system of safety briefings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I think we have become very good at engaging with the workforce.  Like any job, we have an overall induction, but we also do specific inductions for every specific works undertaken.  These, along with daily briefings, ensure engagement at all levels and promotes our safety philosophy from the very start.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kemm added: “The design, engineering, construction, assurance and process teams work closely with all members of the BAA team and the supply chain in ensuring there is full engagement with the workforce.  We have based a good deal of our safety philosophy in engaging with the supervisors and operatives on the ground and our supply chain, which we have done through a variety of mechanisms, but all based around the Costain Cares and behavioural-based safety approach.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We have tried very hard to embed safety into the way we do things at Heathrow.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on this achievement Lisa Lewis, a Capital Safety Manager for BAA, expressed her gratitude: “Congratulations to Costain on working over one year at Heathrow without an LTA.  This level of commitment and compliance to health and safety shown by Costain has helped BAA maintain its high level of safety on sites across the airport”.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>22 August 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The search is on for the latest batch of entrants to Costain’s apprenticeship programme, with applications needed by the end of August.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are 10 vacancies available in fields ranging from engineering construction to business administration, at sites from Inverness to near Bristol.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company’s apprenticeship scheme has been running in its current form since 2010 and has been going very well, says Apprenticeship Manager, Val Thompstone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One useful facet of the scheme is that young recruits, who may not have decided on their career path when they join the Company, don’t have to make that choice until halfway through the second year of their apprenticeships. This gives them the chance to switch tracks if they decide their initial choice is not for them, or if they develop a passion for another trade or profession.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apprenticeships are coming back into fashion in the UK after a period in the doldrums.The Government is increasingly encouraging companies to take on apprentices, but Costain is ahead of the pack.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 10 places will be advertised internally and through local enterprise agencies and appropriate training providers. Applicants should initially visit <a href="/">www.costain.com</a> and click through the links from ‘Working with Costain’. Internal applicants are welcome and should apply in the first instance via the iCosnet home page.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shortlisted candidates will normally be invited to an assessment day at the relevant office or project where they will be given the opportunity to look around the project, meet staff and ask any questions they may have.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There will be presentations by senior staff on the project’s scope and aims and the activities the successful candidates are likely to be involved in. They will also learn about the Apprenticeship Scheme in general and meet the training provider.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Current apprentices will also be on hand to give first-hand accounts of what life as an apprentice with Costain is really like.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>21 August 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has been awarded a one-year framework to carry out minor civils work for Anglian Water, which supplies 1.2 billion litres of water every day to its customers in the east of England and Hartlepool.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commencing immediately, the framework consists of undertaking small scale repairs of buildings across the Anglian Water estate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The company operates 1,257 water and wastewater treatment works, or around a quarter of all those in England and Wales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anglian Water provides wastewater services to more than six million domestic and business customers in a region that stretches from the Humber north of Grimsby, to the Thames estuary and from Buckinghamshire to Lowestoft on the east coast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The region includes 1,240 km of coastline which means the treated wastewater has to pass strict quality standards set by law and by water regulator, Ofwat, before it can be returned to nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The framework is Costain’s first with Anglian Water and demonstrates the ongoing success of its ‘Choosing Costain’ strategy, which is focused on targeting the blue-chip customers in chosen sectors whose major spending plans are underpinned by strategic national needs, regulatory commitments or essential maintenance requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain's strategy is both to build on the Group's current strengths and to broaden and improve the quality of earnings streams by accelerating the development of an integrated business, providing front-end engineering consultancy, construction and on-going care and maintenance services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the award, Matt Crabtree, Costain’s Customer Director, said: “We are delighted to have been awarded this framework by Anglian Water and, as a new customer, we very much look forward to helping it achieve its complex delivery programme.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">16 August 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Costain and Laing O’Rourke Joint Venture has excelled in the latest Considerate Constructors Scheme (CCS) assessment, achieving a total score of 38 out of a possible 40 points for its work on the Bond Street Station Upgrade for London Underground.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Out of a total of eight categories, the joint venture team scored a maximum 5 out 5 points in four categories: safety, environment, accountability and being neighbourly. Elsewhere, the team scored 4.5 out of 5 for appearance and being respectful, responsible and considerate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A score of 5 means exceptional measures were taken, while a score of 4 denotes a high level beyond compliance was achieved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain and Laing O’Rourke are redeveloping the London Underground's Bond Street tube station as part of London Underground's Tube Upgrade Programme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work is focused on the north side of London's retail hub on Oxford Street, boosting capacity and creating step free access to the station. The project will increase commuter capacity in time to receive Crossrail traffic in the heart of Central London once services commence in 2018.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team is hoping to improve on the Silver Award it received at the most recent Considerate Constructors Scheme National Site Awards in March.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brian Sweeney, the CCS Monitor, commended the team’s commitment to safety and innovation, particularly for its wind powered road signs. He also said the documentation outlining the project’s compliance with the Scheme as well as having a designated CCS Champion for each section of the code showed an outstanding level of commitment to CCS.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Co-ordinators were appointed to help drive improvements in each section of the CCS guidelines, and this enabled staff and on-site operatives to influence how the project was viewed by the general public and construction industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“[Bond Street] is an exemplary project. The level of available information to the general public and the liaison with adjacent neighbours is excellent,” Brian added.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Community Relations and Security Manager, Paul Neal, said: “The area around Bond Street and Oxford Street is one of the busiest shopping areas in the UK, if not in Europe, so to achieve such a high score in the CCS is a fantastic achievement for the team. We tried to embrace every element of the CCS and to take an innovative approach in embedding a considerate culture. Our job now is to maintain this high standard and build on what we’ve achieved for the benefit of all stakeholders.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">15 August 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The UK’s waste sector faces enormous challenges to meet future demand, from developing new waste infrastructure to diverting waste from landfill in order to capitalise on its value, both in material and energy terms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These challenges and many more will be discussed at the Resource Efficiency &amp; Waste Management Solutions Show at the NEC, in Birmingham, on September 11-13.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Organised in partnership with the Chartered Institution of Wastes Management, the show will focus on the future of waste management and the risks inherent in delivering waste infrastructure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking at the event will be Martin Hopkins, Costain’s Waste Sector Director. Martin will be speaking in the Leaders’ Theatre on Thursday 13th September on a subject called “Collaboration for cost savings and innovation – how can the industry work more closely together and what are the major opportunities?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The social and economic needs for new waste infrastructure are certainly compelling. The Institution of Civil Engineers estimates that the UK needs over 2,000 new waste treatment facilities by 2020 in order to transform the country from simply 'digging and dumping' into a fully-fledged energy and resource recovery industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The challenges facing the industry are multi-faceted. The technology has become more complex and more dominated by power and process engineering. Landfill tax, legislation, and the wider environment agenda are driving greater segregation of waste and more material recovery, and commercial and industrial sector clients - retail, manufacturing, construction - are looking for solutions that benefit the bottom line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Moreover, the EU Landfill Directive means that the UK can no longer rely on its historical solution of sending waste to landfill. The UK needs to develop infrastructure so that, by 2020, it send only 35% of the volume of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW) to landfill that it sent in 1995. If the UK fails to meet this target it could face fines from the European Court of Justice of up to £0.5 million per day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Elsewhere, the basic feedstock for the new infrastructure is also changing. Products and packaging are smarter and more resource efficient, a wider range of materials is being recovered from our waste, and as these trends continue, the volume and composition of waste in the future becomes harder to predict.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But the cost of developing this new waste infrastructure needs to be funded. It is estimated that over £10billion of investment is required by 2020 through a combination of major public and private sector investment. However, the way major projects are now financed has also changed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“There is no doubt the funding landscape is more challenging than ever before, with investment channels now more risk averse as a result of general economic environment. In the past, PFI might have smoothed the way for some municipal waste infrastructure, although even this funding model has had its difficulties. Now, though, local authorities are required to explore other options and any success in terms of merchant capacity is likely to be even harder won. That is why we need to find ways, as an industry, to collaborate more effectively and be more innovative in how we deliver cost saving solutions for our customers,” said Martin.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">14 August 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain recently supported a Remarkable Robotics Fun Day at the Lakes College in Workington, Cumbria, to help introduce children to the wonders of science.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event was organised by Lakes College and was supported by Claire Sedgwick from Costain Support Services and Luke Richardson, Costain Community Relations Officer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The children, aged between 9 and 11, designed and constructed their own robots as part of a series of summer educational camps which aims to help promote science, technology and engineering. The robots were then entered into a ‘Robot Olympic Games’ and tested on their ability to follow direction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The children also had the opportunity to carry out some of the experiments themselves, which involved using static electricity to bending water and race empty drinks cans around the room using only the static electricity created from their hair and a balloon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The aim of the day was to try and fire up the children’s imaginations and open their eyes to the possibilities of what science can do. The reaction from the kids was fantastic. Any activity that encourages children to experience the possibilities of science and technology in a fun way can only be a good thing,” said Claire.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">8 August 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain-Skanska Joint Venture (jv) handling the Crossrail C405 Paddington Station contract has had its approach to the prevention of accidents and ill health recognised with a Gold Award in this year’s RoSPA Awards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contract involves excavating a huge box measuring 260 metres long by 28 wide and 25 deep for the new Crossrail station alongside the existing terminus. Work began in February and the contract includes creating the main concourse, platforms and fit-out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The RoSPA Awards recognise commitment to accident and ill health prevention and look not only at accident records, but also entrants’ overarching health and safety management systems, including important practices such as strong leadership and workforce involvement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">David Rawlins, RoSPA awards manager, commented: “We congratulate Costain-Skanska on its success and encourage it, and all our other winners, to remain committed to safety and health, an approach that is well recognised to be good for workers and the bottom line.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Project Director, Martin Quaid, said: "The team is delighted to have won this award, which is recognition of our commitment to continuous improvement in accident and ill health prevention. We will continue to strive for an injury-free environment as we believe it’s possible to get there."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Project Manager, Rupert Shingleton, added: “I think the key thing we’ve had to achieve is attention to detail because of the constrained nature of the site. We’re having to put in exceptionally large machinery associated with de-walling in an area equivalent to the width of a couple of road traffic lanes.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">7 August 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s rail sector has achieved 2.5 million man hours with a zero accident frequency rate (AFR).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Staff have also racked up an enviable all accident frequency rate (AAFR) of 2.01, which is also below the Group’s limit of 2.5.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rail has a number of challenging projects, often in safety-critical environments, usually in full view of the client, authorities and travelling public. The sector’s safety record showed continued improvement in the first half of 2012, with potential areas of weakness being carefully scrutinised as, or even before, they develop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s all about strong leadership, open and honest reporting culture and the trending of data to mitigate developing trends,” said Rail SHE Manager, Matthew Wilcock. “We also ensure that we learn from previous accidents / incidents and ensure we change the way we do things to do as much as we can to prevent a repeat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We also focus very closely on near-misses. If you fully close out your near-misses, then you’re significantly reducing the potential for a major accident or incident.” The more near-misses that are reported, the more opportunities there are to nip a problem in the bud.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A good example of this is at the Reading Station contract, where Project Director, Brian Fisher, has delivered a near-miss ratio that consistently meets or exceeds the Rail Sector target.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“What Brian has done particularly well is he’s shown good leadership in making sure this is always at the forefront of people’s minds,” said Matthew. “The Reading project has an exemplar culture of reporting near-misses and a reinforced no-blame culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Director of Rail, Gren Edwards, praised the achievement in the Rail newsletter, while cautioning against over-confidence: “Thank you all for your contribution to this outstanding performance and achievement; it is a truly great delivery! But don’t forget, ‘You are only as good as your last job.’ We really have to utilise the right behaviours and deploy the right processes all the time to maintain this level of excellence. Let’s make this a habit!”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">6 August 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain will be providing one of the keynote speakers for a major conference this autumn aimed at increasing the use of mobile IT in the construction industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Systems and Technology Director, Bill Price, will be among those taking part in BIMobility Day, a conference organised by Construction Opportunities for Mobile IT (COMIT) in London on 15 November. The theme will be how Business Information Modelling (BIM), specifically information mobility, can be built into the sector’s business processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A key factor in achieving successful integration of the construction industry supply chain is the accuracy, effective flow and intelligent use of information. This requires interoperability of information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In September 2009 Paul Morrell, the Government’s Chief Construction Advisor, outlined an Industry working group, commissioned by the Department for Business Innovation and Skills to provide a report on the potential future use of BIM.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The working group’s report was presented in March 2011 and provided a suggested roadmap and strategy to enable the progressive use of BIM on Government building programmes, as well as providing a framework for procurement and delivery standards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COMIT is currently looking at how information currently in paper document form can be captured in digital format, so it can be used by site teams.  “Over the next five years we want to be the catalyst or voice for the construction industry in this field,” said Sharika Fernando, COMIT’s Projects and Marketing Manager. COMIT is a non profit-making organisation that helps its members to realise benefits from the use of mobile information and communication technologies.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">3 August 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, a leading engineering solutions provider, is pleased to announce that it has been awarded two contracts. Firstly, in Joint Venture, a £102m Northern Ireland Roads Service contract awarded for the design and construction phase of the A8 Belfast to Larne Dualling, split equally between the Joint Venture partners, Costain, Lagan Construction and Ferrovial Agroman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Joint Venture will design, construct, and provide aftercare for the whole of the A8 Dualling Belfast to Larne Works. The A8 is a strategically important road within Northern Ireland, servicing the port of Larne and carrying in excess of 17,000 vehicles daily.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The award follows on from the successful completion of the Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) consultancy phase of the scheme, announced on 28 January 2010. The work will begin immediately and is expected to complete in winter 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Separately, Costain has also been appointed as preferred bidder design and build contractor by Severn Trent Water to replace its largest covered service reservoir sited at Fritchley, near Ambergate, Derbyshire, in a project worth around £27 million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ambergate reservoir is an asset of key strategic importance to Severn Trent Water with the capacity to supply mains water to approximately 590,000 customers across the East Midlands. The scheme will see the construction of two covered reservoirs of 90 and 50ML capacity, to replace the current 128ML reservoir.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A planning application has been submitted and is currently under consideration by the local planning authority. Once approved work is due to begin on site in January 2013 for four years, with some early enabling works taking place in coming months.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive of Costain, said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“We are delighted to have been awarded these two contracts. They demonstrate, not only the breadth of our service offering, but also our ability to deliver strategically vital infrastructure projects from the initial design stage, through consultation and project feasibility, to this stage enabling project delivery to commence; as we continue to meet the national needs.”</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“Our focus continues in working closely with our partners to deliver excellent outputs for our customers.”</strong></em></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>1 August 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has been invited to join a task group that is charged with developing a strategy for using Building Information Modelling technology on future construction projects in Wales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the Supplier Working Group, Costain will contribute its knowledge and experience of using BIM technology and make recommendations for its future use as part of the Welsh Construction Procurement Strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group was brought together by the Welsh Government and Constructing Excellence in Wales and comprises a Steering Group and three Working Groups – Client, Supplier and Experiential - to bring together the views and findings of the Group.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Milica Kitson, the Chief Executive of Constructing Excellence in Wales, said her organisation will use the huge wealth of expertise available to prepare a set of recommendations that will form a key strand of the Welsh Construction Procurement Strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is being launched in the autumn so our Task and Working Groups have a clear and defined timescale over which to respond. This is our opportunity to influence what we the Industry want and are able to deliver for Wales through BIM,” said Milica.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has used BIM technology on a number of major contracts, most recently at Bond Street and London Bridge, and having an in-depth knowledge of how to make to make best use of BIM technology is now seen as a prerequisite to securing future work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BIM is now seen as an invaluable component in the construction process as it allows engineers to generate and manage an enormous amount of data by checking for structural, architectural and building services clashes within existing structures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It also allows the end user to build up a body of data that can be used in the repair and maintenance of an asset and potentially extend its life, which can also save time and money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, in partnership with Atkins, Halcrow and RPS Group, is currently using BIM on the A465 Heads of the Valleys Road project in South Wales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting, Tim Bowen, Costain’s Regional Development Director, said: “We are delighted to have been appointed to the Constructing Excellence in Wales BIM Task Group. Costain has a proven track record in bringing innovation from the many different sectors in which it works in order to enhance the overall service to its customers.  This is a clear example of how Costain is prepared to collaborate and share innovation to improve the performance of our customer’s operations.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">31 July 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain/Skanska joint venture commenced work to build the new Crossrail Station below Eastbourne Terrace in Paddington in February 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In January this year it teamed up with Paddington Waterside Partnership (PWP) to draw up a community involvement package, supporting a range of local charities and schools.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under the Crossrail ‘Community Investment Programme’ all of the major contractors constructing the new Crossrail tunnels and stations will develop similar schemes of local support, to create a lasting benefit in the communities in which they’re working.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">April 2012 saw the first three reading volunteers from Costain/Skanska placed by PWP at local Hallfield Primary School, just ten minutes walk from their offices on Eastbourne Terrace. Each week the volunteers (the Community Relations Manager, a Civil Engineer and a Buyer) spend an hour reading with two pupils each, helping them to gain a greater interest in reading and lifting their confidence outside the busy classroom setting. Three more volunteers start next term.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">James York, Community Relations Manager from Costain/Skanska said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Leaving the pressures of work for one hour a week and immersing myself in a whole new world, with children whose perspective and outlook on life is wholly innocent is extremely gratifying and gives a real sense of perspective. Being able to offer them time and real world experience that they wouldn’t have had otherwise is highly rewarding and something I would encourage others to make time and get involved.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not content with providing reading volunteers, Costain/Skanska is planning a facelift of the school’s toilets and washrooms over the summer holidays. Providing all the materials and labour a team of ten people will work solidly for two days to turn the dark rooms into modern, fresh and bright facilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Maria Martin, Business Manager at Hallfield Primary School said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The School is very grateful for the continued support these local volunteers give to our children and we are looking forward to this summer’s redecoration projects at Hallfield, thanks to the team at Costain/Skanska.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain/Skanska has also been supporting local homeless charity, The Marylebone Project, hiring its meeting rooms and facilities for ‘off site’ training and planning days, rather than using hotel or conference venues, making a real impact by investing locally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Its programme for the first year at Paddington also involves support to Paddington Academy’s ‘Science Academy’ scheme, with engineers giving careers talks to students at the nearby Academy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kay Buxton, Paddington Waterside Partnership’s Chief Executive, said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain/Skanska has really bitten the bullet at Paddington, rolling up their sleeves and getting involved with the local community at a number of different levels. This is genuine engagement, innovation and impact. We place an average of 500 volunteers each year with almost 60 local schools and charities. Costain/Skanska will be on board for seven years in Paddington, and we’re delighted that the team has already made such a difference in just a few months.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>30 July 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has won a potentially significant role in shaping the future of urban development through a five-year research project funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Its input to the Liveable Cities study will help academics from four universities – Birmingham, Lancaster, Southampton and University College London – focus their research on this area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain was invited to help prepare the funding application for the £10 million study through participation in several workshops. It was invited not only because its expertise in areas such as transport and utilities has a bearing on city life but because of its social agenda, exemplified by Costain Cares.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The latter’s focus on areas such as the environment and relationships chimes with aspects of future city life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company will benefit from having access to a network of leading minds that may help it further develop Costain Cares.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The main input we will be consulted on is where the research should focus and what trials might be relevant,” said Group Technical Director, Bill Hewlett. “The outcomes will influence academic teaching and research work within universities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain’s involvement in transformational research allows us to engage and understand future national needs,” added Group Innovation Manager, Tim Embley. “This allows us to improve our front end consultancy services to our customers on the best approach and solutions to today’s challenges.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Running the study is Professor Chris Rogers, Director of the University of Birmingham’s Centre for Resilience Research and Education.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The centre looks at issues such as sustainability and how urban facilities will continue to function if the circumstances that dictated their design change in future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This, said Chris, could mean a move away from the recent fashion of ‘optimising’ construction designs – creating structures to do just sufficient to fulfil a brief – and building in smarter ‘adaptivity’ to allow for contingencies and greater resilience to future changes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The research will also look at more intangible issues, such as ‘wellbeing’, or quality of life, which chimes with aspects of Costain Cares.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In bidding for funding for this type of research, it was essential to attract the wider stakeholder community, he said. Costain’s involvement came about after he met Bill and recognised Costain’s innovative stance on finding solutions to infrastructure problems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We invited him and other free thinkers to a workshop and explored all the issues around our research,” said Chris.  “Bill got involved in helping shape this research and gave us his input on the way he thought it would be useful for our research to go.” Moving forward, part of his contribution will be to suggest radical engineering solutions to help create sustainable, liveable cities, said Chris.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More information about the Liveable Cities research project can be found at <a href="http://www.liveablecities.org.uk">www.liveablecities.org.uk</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Liveable Cities research project is being led by Prof. Chris Rogers (University of Birmingham), Prof. Rachel Cooper (Lancaster University), Prof. Nick Tyler and Prof. Brian Collins (University College London) and Prof. AbuBakr Bahaj (University of Southampton).</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">25 July 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is backing an ‘Olympic’ event with a difference in South London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Project Skills Co-ordinator, Patricia Walker, and the site team behind the new Deptford Green School project, in Lewisham, are sponsoring a sports and cultural event at the site that will bring together local pupils and their teachers with counterparts from its Ugandan ‘sister school’, Emmanuel Okiria St Kizito, in Kampala.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Head teacher, Peter Campling, and a group of teachers have worked over the past year to plan the activities, which reflect both the vision and variety of the Olympics themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ten pupils and two tutors are due to arrive from Uganda for an International Olympic Youth Conference over a long weekend of events in August with around 90 pupils from Deptford Green.  Sports events (which will spread into neighbouring Fordham Park) will include football, table tennis and dance theatre. There will also be music, poetry, debates and art sessions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It will be the final event to be held in the old Deptford Green school building, which will be replaced at the start of the next school term in September by the new Costain-constructed school elsewhere on the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pupils will move into the new building in two stages up to March 2013. “The conference will also be an opportunity to say goodbye to the old school and they are so very looking forward to moving into the fantastic new school in September,” said Patricia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among the event’s attractions, groups of pupils will be taken to see Olympic volleyball and basketball events in London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain and its subcontractors at Deptford Green raised some £2,000 towards the event.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Like the Olympics in Stratford, Costain hopes to leave a legacy in the area when it leaves Deptford Green. This includes work experience for more than 30 pupils in Lewisham and apprenticeships for local youngsters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We hope the conference will bring together young Londoners from our culturally rich and diverse local area and who represent many corners of the globe so they can meet new friends, enjoy themselves, celebrate sport and creativity and know what it means to be a truly global citizen,” said Patricia.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">24 July 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Children are enjoying a new wildlife pond and outdoor classroom at Moseley Primary School, Coventry thanks to Costain and its suppliers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The school approached Costain some months ago to ask for help turning a drab corner of the school grounds into an area in which pupils and teachers could spend time and enjoy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Engineer, Paul Higgins of the Coundon Reservoir Renewal team, stepped up to manage the scheme and persuaded many suppliers and subcontractors to get involved. The response was amazing with the majority of materials, plant and labour supplied completely free of charge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ivor Goodsite of the Considerate Constructors’ Scheme made a special appearance to welcome the children to their new outdoor classroom alongside Costain staff and representatives from Jewson’s.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The area was officially opened by Roslyn Winstone who designed a winning Pond Safety Poster as part of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paul said: It’s an honour to get the chance to give something back to the community in which we have been working and it was a pleasure to come to work every day as the staff could not have been more helpful and polite and the kids could not have been more exited. Along with all the suppliers that donated plant and materials I would like to thank the team of people I had working with me and the rest of the team at Coundon. It’s a perfect example of what working together can achieve.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Asset Creation Manager, Derek James, said: "You have a fine ambassador in Paul and the team at Coundon and they are doing a great job promoting Costain and the construction industry at Moseley School and Coundon reservoir. Thank you on behalf of Severn Trent Water for a job well done!"</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our thanks go to Pond Safety, Jewson, Bradshaws Direct, Bunzl, Speedy, GRS Roadstone Ltd, Syston Fencing Company Ltd, Gardiners Construction, Clews Recycling Ltd and Elliott whose generosity made this project happen.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">23 July 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new stage in the revitalisation of Reading railway station is underway with the start of a major bridge slide across the rail tracks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the station’s three-year, £80million upgrade, a new ‘transfer deck’ will replace the existing footbridge across the tracks. The new deck will have considerably greater capacity than the old structure and feature escalators down to platforms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 100-metre deck is being constructed in three sections at a site beside the tracks. The first 50-metre section was pushed 28 metres out over the railway over four nights from 5 July. The bridge slide was carried out by bridge jacking experts Dorman Long Technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The second section is due to be built and launched over the railway by the end of August leaving the third section to be erected in situ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The weight of the first section jacked in July is around 729 tonnes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Brian Fisher, Project Director of the Costain Hochtief JV handling the station project, said: “The phases of erecting the deck were being carried out around the Olympic embargo, during which many construction jobs in and around London are suspended in order to minimise disruption during the Games.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The embargo started on 12 July, with the second slide taking place during the gap between the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The final section can then be constructed in the area adjacent to track.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s a relatively straightforward, but technically complex operational job,” said Brian.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work on the station generally is proceeding steadily, with 24-hour working the norm over the past four months to ensure the project’s demanding deadline is met. The new transfer deck is due to open at the end of March 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reading is one of the UK’s busiest stations outside London, with around 17 million passengers passing through it every year.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">23 July 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has received independent accreditation for reducing its carbon footprint following an external audit by Achilles to the Certified Emissions Measurement and Reduction Scheme (CEMARS).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accreditation to CEMARS means Costain’s commitment over the last three years to accurately report and reduce its carbon emissions has been officially recognised. The CEMARS standard includes a yearly review to ensure the Company continues to meet its reduction goals, which are in line with the Company’s Corporate Responsibility (CR) initiative, Costain Cares.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Research published in 2011 by the business-led charity, Business in the Community (BITC), showed that companies with a greater CR standard, like Costain Cares, benefit in the long run from increased shareholder value and winning new business. Reducing the environmental impact of its business has been an important part of Costain’s CR strategy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We have made great strides over the last three years in significantly reducing our absolute emissions by 50% and our emissions intensity by 30%,” said Amy Shuffleton, Costain’s Group Environmental Manager.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s emissions come from bulk fuel use, electricity and gas usage, business mileage and also from indirect emissions such as rail and air travel, water usage and the disposal of waste at landfill.  The newly accredited Footprint only includes the Company’s UK operations and emissions from sources within its direct operational control.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Joint Ventures, international operations and its acquisitions in 2011 are not currently included although it is hoped that its acquisitions will be included from 2012 onwards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s method of reporting is in accordance with and certified against ISO 14064-1:2006 and is also in line with CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme’s reporting guidelines which enables the Company to achieve credit in the scheme’s Early Action Metric.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Amy said the reduction in carbon emissions is due to a number of strategies being implemented across the Group, such as changing the makeup of the fleet to include lower emission vehicles, the introduction of conference calls, greater employee energy awareness through training, waste reductions and working with its supply chain to ensure it uses low carbon equipment where possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, Amy said more work needs to be done and that more challenging targets have been set.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain aims to see a 55% reduction in Emission Intensity by 2020 against a 2009 baseline by actively engaging with its employees, customers and supply chain.  Costain is also working with its customers to provide them with low cost low carbon solutions to help reduce their carbon emissions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We all need to take responsibility for trying to reduce our carbon footprint. We hope to achieve our 2020 target by getting everyone in the Company involved by incentivising green initiatives like car sharing, by promoting alternative on-site energy sources or by simply getting connected to the grid a lot earlier instead of using bulk fuel generators which have a higher carbon emission impact,” said Amy.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">17 July 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain Skanska joint venture team delivering Crossrail’s new underground station in Paddington recently gave terminally ill children an opportunity to become construction workers for the afternoon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The children were attending a wishing party arranged by the charity Starlight at the Honourable Artillery Company in London. For one magical afternoon, the children and their families were able to escape to a wonderland inspired purely by their imaginations. From fashion to cowboys and action heroes; bouncy castles; cars, fire engines and a digger.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The JV team was on hand along with the Considerate Constructors Scheme to give these children their first induction into the construction industry. They were provided with their own sets off PPE and given the opportunity to pretend to operate the five tonne mini excavator with some guidance from the team, which included Alison Kendall, Elena Angelova, James York, Luc Williams and Nuha Behnam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Paddington team was invited to attend the day by Starlight (the project's chosen charity for 2012) and called on the supply chain to lend a hand. In particular Keltbray kindly supplied the mini excavator, which allowed many of the children a once in a life opportunity, of which they adored and in fact some were very upset when mum and dad tried to drag them away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">James York, Community Relations Manager, said: “The day was a resounding success for all involved and was deeply moving for the team to see these very ill children and their brothers and sisters experiencing a day they will never forget.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Charlotte Webster of Starlight said when thanking the project for its help: “What a day!!  Not only did you make a very generous contribution to the overall party with the amazing digger, hard hats and high viz - all of which the children loved - but you also made a huge difference by helping us look after your area, and for kindly helping us the night before to set up the event."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was also encouraging for a male dominated industry that she noted: “Every child that came absolutely adored getting on and off the digger and in fact I saw more girls than boys!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Starlight brightens the lives of seriously and terminally ill children by granting them once-in-a-lifetime wishes and providing entertainment for children in hospitals and hospices throughout the United Kingdom.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">11 July 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain picked up three awards last night at the 2012 Construction News Awards which included Project of the Year Above £50million for the M53 Bidston Moss Viaduct Strengthening Project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Around 1,000 guests attended the event at the Grosvenor House Hotel to recognise outstanding performances in the construction industry throughout the year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Managing Director of Infrastructure, Darren James, said he was extremely proud of Bidston Moss’s achievements, not only in completing the strengthening and refurbishment of the 730-metre long viaduct on time and under budget, but also for consistently achieving the highest standard of performance and team work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As well as the Construction News Award, the team achieved record scores in its Project Performance Assessment (PPA), which covers safety, leadership and stakeholder management, and the project’s excellent health and safety record was rewarded with three Gold RoSPA Awards during the life of the contract.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Construction News Judges said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"The judges commented that this winning project was not only delivered early and under budget but the most outstanding achievement was a zero accident frequency rate despite over 1.2million man hours worked."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Located on the Wirral in North West England, the Bidston Moss Viaduct is a major artery that carries the M53 over local roads and a railway line towards the Kingsway Tunnel and Liverpool. Over 50,000 vehicles use the viaduct on a daily basis, including 3,000 heavy goods vehicles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Last night’s Construction News Awards was a culmination of over three years’ worth of first class service delivery for one of our major customers, the Highways Agency, and I am extremely proud of Simon Ellison and his team for delivering consistently outstanding results,” said Darren.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Andy Bull, Costain’s Environmental Services Director, picked up the Best Use of Technology Award for SwingletCAM, a small ready-to-deploy micro aircraft with an 80cm wingspan and a built-in high resolution camera.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The technology can be used to speed up planning and progress reports by allowing the user to highlight potential problems much faster and in far greater detail than traditionally manned aerial photography.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Construction News Judges said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Our winner here showed real cost effective innovation with multiple potential applications particularly in parts of the world where satellite or Google Earth mapping is not readily available.  The judges were very impressed as this entrant scored highly on savings in carbon, cost and time."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain has an excellent reputation for providing innovative solutions to problems, therefore we’re delighted to have been recognised in the technology category with SwingletCAM,” said Andy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Elsewhere, Costain’s James Bulleid picked up the Rising Star of The Year Award.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since joining Costain in 2008 as a graduate trainee, James has stood out as one to watch for the future. He originally worked as a Site Engineer on the award winning £90million Church Village Bypass Scheme for Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council and subsequently worked on the successful bid for the A465 and as a Site Agent on the South East Wales Highways framework.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The Construction News Judges said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"The judges felt this young star was not an ordinary individual at all.  They have done a great deal in their private life and at work and have performed in a way that points to a great career ahead."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I am delighted to be recognised for this award. Since the start of my career at Costain, I have been extremely well mentored and have also been lucky enough to have worked on some great projects with some fantastic people,” said James.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">11 July 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Farringdon Station Construction Team has delivered another significant programme milestone by delivering all the Stations' five lifts on time and achieving National recognition by winning this years Network Rail Partnering award for a Major Project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain and Laing O’Rourke’s joint venture, CoLOR, has transformed Farringdon Station as part of the Thameslink upgrade programme. The £200million improvements include greater passenger interchange capacity, the infrastructure to manage new 12-car trains and provisions for the new world-class Crossrail network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Farringdon Project not only won the Major Project award, shared with the Western Concourse at King’s Cross, but on Friday 6 July five new Station lifts were opened for public use. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lifts allow the Station to be step free from both the London Underground (LU)platforms (1&amp;2) and the First Capital Connect platforms (3&amp;4) to street level.  It is the first time five lifts have been constructed and commissioned at the same time in a functioning London Underground station environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Project Director for Network Rail, Mike Brown, said: “A particular mention should be made of the performance of CoLOR &amp; KONE (Lift installers) who have stepped up to the mark over the past months, working in an extremely challenging construction environment to deliver on time. The collective performance and collaborative management of the Farringdon team, in its entirety, played no small part in this achievement.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Major Project Award was given to Farringdon in recognition of the successful complex construction of a new Integrated Ticket Hall, extensions to platforms 3 &amp; 4, installation of new Power Systems, redevelopment of the Grade 2 listed LU building and all in a live Station environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Station, some of it dating back to 1864, is unique in that it’s a London Underground owned and operated asset which incorporates the Thameslink Bedford to Brighton line.  This meant that a high level of detailed planning was required to facilitate the amount of construction adjacent to the LU lines and the Network Rail tracks; the vast majority of work was carried out during either planned possessions or engineering hours, with no overruns throughout the length of the project.  Full station operation was maintained, thanks to bespoke temporary facilities for the 60,000 passengers that use the station every day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team was also highly commended in the Heritage and Sustainability categories.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dan Powrie, Costain’s Construction Director, summarized the latest achievements:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Farringdon team has repeatedly delivered and the handover of the lifts was only achieved by the successful collaboration of all parties; everybody wanted the same goal and everybody went the extra mile to achieve it.  The Partnering Award is the icing on the cake and provides the entire Project team with the recognition they deserve for providing an outstanding world class Project.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">10 July 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain-Carillion joint venture closed a section of the M1 recently for almost 16 hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The route between London and the Midlands was closed between Junctions 11 and 13 to allow the demolition of one of the motorway’s original bridges at Junction 12 as part of the overall programme of improvements at the interchange.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The jv team had between 8pm on Saturday 30 June to noon on Sunday 1 July to remove the 41-metre, 1400-tonne reinforced concrete structure, which previously carried the A5120 that connected Dunstable and Flitwick.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A replacement – constructed from steel beams with an in situ concrete deck – was already in position and operational when the work got underway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The job went smoothly, accomplished using hydraulic breakers, with the jv team able to hand the motorway back 30 minutes ahead of deadline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unsurprisingly, the demolition attracted considerable attention. Regional press helped promote the message that the M1 would be closed and media were onsite to film the work and interview Highways Agency Project Manager, Lynne Stinson.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Local interest was such that public viewing facilities were put in place on the new bridge to allow residents to watch the demolition process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few weeks before the work got underway Angela Barker, Chairwoman of Central Bedfordshire Council, visited the site with the press to speak about the forthcoming demolition. The Highways Agency also produced a four-page leaflet detailing the work and the accompanying diversions for distribution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team took the opportunity of the weekend closure to tackle extra work, meaning less disruption will be needed on other occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This included resurfacing the MSA slip roads, removing lighting columns between Junctions 12 and 13, erecting two gantries and additional gantry signage elsewhere, laying permanent road markings between Junctions 12 and 13 and making central reserve barrier improvements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Along with the bridge demolition, testing of the managed motorway technology and opening and closing the hard shoulder for traffic is ongoing between junctions 10 and 11, with the section due to be fully operational in mid-July. The technology will see the hard shoulder assigned as available to traffic at busy periods to give additional capacity.  Work on the remaining sections between Junctions 11 and 13 continues.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using the hard shoulder removes the requirement for widening, as it provides additional capacity through use of the hard shoulder. Currently used only on the M42 and M6 in the West Midlands, the M1 will employ it under the direction of the Highways Agency East Region Control Centre when required.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>9 July 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has turned in another five-star performance at the Hinkley Point nuclear site in Somerset, with its new catering facility receiving the highest rating attainable from the West Somerset Council Environmental Health Department (EH).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Infrastructure Support Services (formerly Promanex) is on site providing catering services on both the Hinkley Point A site, which is being decommissioned, and Hinkley Point C, due to be the first of a new generation of nuclear power stations. At ‘A’, it also provides a range of services ranging from cleaning and gardening to management of the site’s fire services. The C site is owned by power generator EDF Energy Ltd.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ‘A’ site has had a five-star rating for at least five years, but the new catering facility won the top ranking in its first assessment after only opening for business in April.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The EH rates it on the safety aspects of how it’s set up,” explained Dave Sutton, Site Manager with Costain Infrastructure Support Services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The inspector bases the inspection on a system known as HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control points), which is a method of measuring and recording every step from the purchasing to serving of food.  At each step you have measurement of safety, for example, checking temperatures in storage areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is a testament to the knowledge of the catering teams on both sites that these excellent results are achieved.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Dave put it when relaying the news of the latest success: “Slightly pleased!!!”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">4 July 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A-one+, a joint venture between Costain, Colas and Halcrow, together with its supply chain partners Highways Resource Solutions and VeRSco, recently won honours at the Chartered Institute of Highways &amp; Transportation’s Annual Awards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The awards ceremony took place at Gibson Hall in London recently, where representatives from A-one+ joined HRH The Princess Royal, Lord Digby Jones Kt and over 300 guests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A-one+ scooped four awards, including the winner of the Health &amp; Safety at Work Award, for its work with Highways Resource Solutions in developing Intellicone, an integrated safety solution for road maintenance contractors that has helped to significantly enhance road worker safety.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In many cases road traffic cones are the only delineation that road workers have to the adjacent traffic and, if a cone barrier is breached, there is little or no way of alerting the road workers to the subsequent dangers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A-one+ is the MAC Contractor for the Highways Agency in Areas 7, 10, 12, and 14. This includes operating and maintaining 1,700km of trunk roads and motorways in England, or roughly 32% of the national network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Through a process of reporting near misses, A-one+ identified errant vehicles as one of the top risks that needed to be managed across its four MACs. A working group in Area 12 was set up to look at how innovative technology could combat the problem of errant vehicles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with HRS, A-one+ developed a unique, low cost technology that turned ordinary traffic cones into an intelligent wireless network which is able to activate an alarm and report any perimeter breaches.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Intellicone received a commendation in the Innovation category and was recognised as an outstanding example of a new development that has made a positive contribution to the health and safety of employees and the general public.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commending the Intellicone technology, the judges said: “The judging panel was very impressed by this novel idea and praised the project’s capability for widespread application for road works in the future. Judges highlighted the increased level of protection that it affords to road workers from the dangers of errant vehicles in high risk maintenance and work areas.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A-one+ was also Highly Commended in the Sustainability category for its work in renovating vehicle restraint systems (VRS) which restores barriers to a required standard for re-use following an incident or general maintenance work. The team was recognised for helping to deliver a step change in its drive to deliver efficiency and reduce the environmental impact of its maintenance operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The judges described VRS as a “simple, clever idea; a step change and novel application of recycling which reduced the use of valuable resources. It provides sustainability through ease of use, quicker repairs from stock which is more readily available and also has significant environmental benefits by minimising the need for new material.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">3 July 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, working with Southern Water on its Capital Improvement Asset Management Programme as part of 4Delivery Ltd* (4D), has gained National Skills Academy for Construction (NSAfC) status for the next three years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Achieving Academy status is a first for the water frameworks as it will cover around 70 sites across Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, rather than having a project-based Academy where the workforce is based in one location.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The aim of the National Skills Academy for Construction is to improve the performance of projects and deliver a legacy of improved skills by harnessing the training and employment opportunities within the construction industry’s supply chain, including clients, professional services, contractors and sub-contractors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The National Skills Academy agenda provides an on-site virtual training academy that will support the project in the following areas:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• The 14 – 19 years agenda supporting schools, colleges, universities and other local authority schemes with advice guidance and work experience opportunities;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• New entrants into construction such as apprentices and graduates;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Upskilling project and the supply chain staff with Leadership &amp; Management, Health &amp; Safety and National Vocational Qualifications; and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Leaving a legacy for the local community by providing employment and work experience opportunities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This support will be provided through a funded Project Skills Co-ordinator with their role acting as a focal point between the client, project and supply chain, local authority, employment agencies, training providers and the local community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The workforce will receive an average of four days’ skills training per person per annum and included in the outcomes that the project will deliver are 26 Apprentices, 52 number 14 to 19 work experience placements and 120 curriculum support events.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting, Costain’s Water Sector Director, Graham Keegan, said: “We are delighted to have been awarded National Skills Academy for Construction (NSAfC) status. Creating opportunities for young people within the construction industry and upskilling the existing workforce is central to our Costain Cares strategy and this initiative will hopefully leave a lasting legacy for the communities in which we serve.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4D Training Manager and Academy Lead, George Hilliar, added: “This is an exciting challenge in delivering training and support across a dispersed workforce and large geographical area.  With support from Construction Skills and the projects knowledge and experience, we will deliver a legacy recognised by all our stakeholders.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">* 4Delivery Ltd is a consortium comprising Costain, Veolia Water and Montgomery Watson Harza (MWH).</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">28 June 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, one of the UK's leading engineering solutions providers, is today issuing a pre-close trading update ahead of its interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2012, which will be announced on Thursday 23 August 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trading update</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has performed strongly over the first half and is on-course to deliver a result for the year which is in-line with the Board’s expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the first half, the Group has continued to secure significant new awards and extensions to existing contracts as a result of focussing on blue chip public and private sector customers whose spending plans are driven by national need, regulatory commitments or essential maintenance requirements</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group’s forward order book stands at £2.4 billion (30 June 2011: £2.3 billion). In addition, Costain continues to maintain a strong preferred bidder position of over £400 million. As at the end of the first half, c. £850 million of revenue has been secured for 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reflecting the transformational impact of the ‘Choosing Costain’ strategy on the Group, Costain has today announced the formation of a new joint venture with Severn Trent plc to provide complete business water and waste water management services to high volume commercial and industrial water users.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Management Appointments</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In June the Group announced a strengthening of its Executive Board with the appointments of Mark Rogerson as Chief Development Officer and Tim Bowen as Regional Development Director to be based in the Middle East. Simon Ellison has been appointed as Highways Director in succession to Tim Bowen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Group Pension Scheme</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In February 2012, the Group announced two further actions being taken to manage the obligations in the legacy Costain Pension Scheme (the ‘CPS’). The first of these was the transfer of the Group’s interest in two PFI investments into the CPS at an agreed value of £20.3m which was completed on 22 February 2012 and resulted in an accounting profit on the transfer of £10.2 million. The second action was the implementation of Enhanced Transfer Value (‘ETV’) and Pension Increase Exchange (‘PIE’) offers to the members of the CPS. The ETV and PIE exercises have now been completed and resulted in a reduction in the scheme liabilities and assets of approximately £35 million and will result in a one-off accounting cost of circa £3.5 million to be expensed in 2012. Together, the actions reduce the accounting pension deficit (before deferred tax) by approximately £18 million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Interim Results</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain will announce interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2012 on Thursday 23 August 2012. There will be a presentation to analysts at 09.30 that morning at the offices of College Hill: The Registry, Royal Mint Court, London, EC3.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">28 June 2012</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Costain Group PLC and Severn Trent Plc have entered into a new Joint Venture (‘JV’) to provide complete business water and wastewater management services to high volume commercial and industrial water users.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The new entity, Severn Trent Costain, will combine the skills and experience of both Severn Trent Services and engineering solutions provider, Costain, to offer large multi-site water users a single expert supplier for all of their water and waste water requirements, from source to disposal. With a cohesive approach to water management Severn Trent Costain will help customers improve efficiencies, leverage cost savings, manage legal compliance and risk management issues, and resolve water efficiency challenges.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The UK water supply market is undergoing significant change as Government legislation drives increased business retail competition in the competitive UK water market. Severn Trent Costain will be at the forefront of these changes, helping to shape the emerging landscape, and enabling customers to combine their requirements for on-site water services with the opportunity to buy their water from a single national supplier.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Severn Trent Services and Costain have a proven track record in delivering improved efficiencies in water and waste water management through an existing joint venture to operate and maintain over 5,000 assets and 1,300 sites for the Ministry of Defence, one of the largest PFI contracts in Europe.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The two companies will combine parts of their existing operations within the JV (see Note 1 below), in which Costain will have an initial 40% shareholding.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong>Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive of Costain, commented:</strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong><em>“Severn Trent Costain will help customers to manage their water and waste water usage in the most efficient, compliant and cost-effective way. Increasingly, customers are looking for a single expert provider who can help plan and manage their industrial water and waste water use across the full cycle.</em></strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong><em>“We are delighted to be working with Severn Trent to bring our combined expertise in consultation, construction and asset management to bear on this vital issue.”</em></strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong>Tony Wray, Chief Executive of Severn Trent said:</strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong><em>“We are delighted to be working with Costain on this new joint venture. Costain is a long-term partner of Severn Trent Services and together we have already established a track record for successful delivery in the UK.</em></strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><strong><em>“Severn Trent Services is one of the world’s leading suppliers of water and waste water treatment solutions. Together with Costain we will take the initiative in opening up the UK market for business retail competition.”</em></strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Note 1: Costain will contribute the majority of its water hygiene testing business into the JV, comprising gross assets of £0.1 million. The business broke even in the last financial year.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Severn Trent will contribute its UK non regulated, asset operation &amp; maintenance, water hygiene, developer services and Design Build Operate (DBO) business into the JV, comprising gross assets of £0.1 million. The business also made a breakeven PBIT in the last financial year (on revenues of £7.8M).</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>27 June 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is today launching Costain Start-Ups, a new initiative which will create and support innovative business ideas from across the Company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In line with the Company’s Choosing Costain strategy, which meets national needs, Costain is harnessing the knowledge and experience of its people to help build a more sustainable business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Employees are being invited to submit their innovative business idea and, if it’s chosen, the Company will invest in their idea and provide the necessary resources to make it a reality. That could mean help with finance, HR and legal as well as the technical advice needed to bring the business to life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The initiative is also in line with Costain’s transformation from being a construction company into an organisation that can deliver increasingly a full-service offering, from front-end engineering consultancy and design, through construction to back-end care and maintenance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company hopes to deliver this transformation by tapping into the ingenuity of its most valuable resource, its employees. If successful, the candidate will be given the opportunity to work on their idea on a full-time basis in order to develop it and get the business off the ground.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain is committed to providing Intelligent Solutions to our customers’ problems and we also recognise how difficult it is to get good ideas off the ground. We believe that innovation is integral to our business model and this is just one way in which we are looking to support this. This is an exciting opportunity for anyone who has ever wanted to run their own business and who has an idea that provides new intelligent solutions to meet our customers’ needs,” said Ross Agnew, Costain’s Group Strategy Director.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ross said the Company will consider all ideas that align with Costain’s business strategy. The scheme is open to everyone within the business, including its supply chain and customers.</p>
<p>For further information, or to submit an idea, please contact:<br /><a href="mailto:start-ups@costain.com">start-ups@costain.com</a></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">26 June 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain's work to install 1km of temporary pipeline and ancillaries to help recover water levels at Draycote Reservoir in Warwickshire, in March, has contributed to an almost 20% increase in the reservoir's volume since January 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pipeline will be an all year round source of water into Draycote and to the end of May 2012, it had contributed over 2% of the Reservoir capacity, some 480Ml.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pipeline was installed to maximise abstraction consents and improve raw water storage at a time when depleted water levels are creating drought conditions in many parts of the country. The pipeline connects to an existing pump that normally pumps water to Leamington Spa, and now has the added facility of diverting water from the River Leam up to Draycote some nine miles away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Severn Trent's team at Draycote recognised a further opportunity to increase water levels and, following Central Strategy Team negotiations with the Environment Agency (EA), secured consent to pump from Eathorpe (upstream of Leamington on the River Leam) during flood warning periods and outside Severn Trent's regular pumping season. This move had the positive knock-on effect of helping the EA to reduce the risk of flooding further downstream. With this activity alone, the team has been able to abstract 658ml of water over a very short period of time, which equates to approximately 25 days worth of production from the Draycote works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The local Severn Trent team has also managed to increase production from the River Avon sources into Draycote.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Severn Trent has also pumped a great volume of Treated Water from the distribution system into the Reservoir, by utilising capacity from other areas within the Company, via the Treated Water Grid System.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Severn Trents Area Manager, Mick Carvell, said: “We have worked hard with the EA, our internal and Supply Chain partners and I'm pleased to see the positive effect of improving relationships and cooperation between us all. We are now in a much stronger position at Draycote to meet our commitment to the customer of 'Always on and good to drink', for the up and coming summer demand period.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">26 June 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More than 200 years of experience with Costain was celebrated as the Company showed its gratitude to a group of long-serving staff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Grovefield House Hotel, Burnham, was the setting for a special lunch to honour personnel who had completed 21 years with the Group.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event saw the 11 staff receive certificates from Alan Kay, Managing Director, Environment, in which the Group’s directors expressed their congratulations and appreciation for the staff members’ dedication and service to the organisation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each received their certificate to the backdrop of a ‘This Is Your Life’-style presentation, added Alan. “We try to gather photographs of the recipients – either when they first joined the Company or from some amusing events that have occurred during their time here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We give a potted history of their careers, remind them of memorable projects on which they worked and hopefully uncover some anecdotes from people who worked with them.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">HR Director, Fiona Ware, said the annual lunch served a useful purpose: “It’s a celebration really, a celebration and recognition that people have been with the Company for that length of time.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The staff honoured were:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Darren James, Managing Director Infrastructure; Dave Kellett, Senior Agent; David Midgley, Planner; Jean Verity, Administrator; Mark Huddart, Business Development Director; Michelle Eames, Business Development Manager; Nabil Abdo, Agent; Phil Davies, Project Manager; Sian Taylor, Executive Secretary; Stuart Curtis, SHE Advisor; and Vicki Cannon, Bought Ledger Clerk.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>18 June 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following 18 months of major utilities strengthening and replacement works on one of London’s busiest streets, the Costain Laing O’Rourke joint venture, as part of the Bond Street Station Upgrade for London Underground, has re-opened Oxford Street to two-way traffic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The work was required prior to the tunnelling works that will connect the existing station into the new Crossrail route across the capital. It had to be completed in time for the Olympics, due to the Transport for London embargo that will be in place between late June and September.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Oxford Street sits on top of a dense network of sewer, gas, water, electricity and telecommunications systems. Many – notably a 30-inch diameter water main – date from the early or mid-19th century and are made of cast iron. The station upgrade works will require tunnelling under them, starting in 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Because they’re old pipes there’s concern that they could crack,” explained Deputy Project Director David Whiteford. “The 30-inch main is one of the main water feeds into London and the consequences of that breaking in the middle of Oxford Street would be horrendous.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The remedy was to insert plastic sleeves that would be more tolerant of any ground movement inside the iron pipes. However, getting to the existing pipes often meant cutting through huge quantities of old concrete backfilling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We used hydro-demolition techniques to get the concrete out as quickly and safely as we could, without using excavators,” said David.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We were working 24/7 but had to restrict our breaking-out activities so we weren’t jack-hammering right through the night because there are residents and a hotel right by the worksite. Throughout the works we have made it a priority to engage closely with the local community.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Drawing the plastic sleeves through the pipes also proved problematical because of the number of bends in the pipes, which meant the sleeves had to be inserted in sections, then joined up. In all, more than 1.2km of piping had to be replaced with plastic equivalents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The works required extensive traffic management operations diverting up to 110 buses an hour away from Europe’s busiest retailing street and were successfully delivered without a single lost-time incident. This achievement contributed to the project receiving a Considerate Constructors’ Silver award, a London Underground Silver Star and ROSPA Gold Award.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The position of utilities could not be assumed only from existing plans and so “We had to be flexible in dealing with the unexpected,” said David.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We carried out radar surveys before we started, followed by hand-dug trial holes to confirm these surveys. In total, over 1000 Permits to Dig had to be issued over the 18 months. The fact this was done without a significant service strike is a testimony to the diligence of the responsible persons issuing them.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>15 June 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new system deployed on Costain’s London Power Tunnels (LPT) sites is simultaneously helping ensure the Company’s green responsibilities are met while making life easier for site teams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The teams are creating 32km of new deep cable tunnels on behalf of National Grid under the streets of the capital to ensure its population continues to enjoy safe and reliable electricity supplies for years into the future.  Two tunnelling machines, four metres and three metres in diameter, are cutting around 20 metres a day, predominantly through London clay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With 1300 tonnes of spoil being trucked off the sites every day, it is essential to keep track of where it ends up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Previously a paper-based system was used, but collating paper delivery tickets was becoming increasingly time-consuming as well as being liable to human error, especially with multiple road haulage companies involved in moving the spoil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To resolve the problem, the PODfather Earthworks system was introduced. A rugged handheld device is used to scan a barcode on trucks as they arrive empty at the tunnelling sites.  The vehicles are rescanned as they leave laden with spoil. Site and load details are printed as a uniquely barcoded conveyance note that is handed to the driver and automatically recorded and uploaded to a central database.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The barcode is re-scanned when the truck arrives at its destination, creating an electronic ‘paper trail’ and fulfilling Costain’s duty of care requirements for the transportation of construction materials.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ease of use, robust information management and virtual elimination of errors are among the advantages of PODfather over the traditional paper system, said Environmental Manager Daniel Sweeney: “It’s very, very popular with the site teams.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Much of the spoil is being re-used on a variety of National Grid sites for tasks such as decommissioning gasholders, remedial works and capping landfills.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>13 June 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The BBC has featured Costain’s Harbour Way road project in Port Talbot, South Wales, as an example of industry’s community involvement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Radio 4’s File on Four was looking at what the devolved governments of Wales and Scotland were doing to foster local employment opportunities in public sector projects. The Welsh Assembly has made a point of taking into account indirect benefits such as new jobs for local unemployed people as well as lowest price when awarding tenders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Harbour Way Project Manager John Skentelbery was among those interviewed for the programme, explaining Costain’s aim of maximising local employment opportunities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He said that 33 local unemployed people had been taken on, both by Costain itself and by members of its supply chain, including security personnel, carpenters and assistant engineers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the tender process, “We made a commitment that we would employ one unemployed person for every £1 million of turnover,” he explained later.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As well as providing jobs, the Company also encouraged locally-employed staff to take qualifications such as NVQs that could be of future benefit to them. “Hopefully we can retain them and they will go on to the next job with us. Several people that we employed on the Church Village bypass, for example, came down to Port Talbot with us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“But if the opportunities aren’t there at the end of this job, at least they’re fully armed for the job market.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We have several assistant engineers who haven’t come through the degree route. We’re training them and they’re going to day release classes at local colleges, going through a BTEC in civil engineering. Some taken on are going through HNCs and one is going on to a degree.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Director of Highways Tim Bowen added: “We make a point of doing this and have done it in a number of locations. It’s part of our responsibility of putting something back into the local community and giving them a long-term benefit.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">11 June 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of Costain’s project teams has achieved an impressive performance following its latest inspection under the Considerate Constructors Scheme (CCS).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three-person team at Oxted Wastewater Treatment Works (WWTW) in Surrey notched up a score of 37/40 for its efforts to provide a well-run site that was a good neighbour to nearby residents. The team operates as part of 4D, the consortium made up of Veolia Water, Costain and MWH.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction Manager Daniel Chilcott, Site Engineer Halil Zorba and General Foreman Dave Wass are responsible for updating the Oxted plant to comply with stricter EU regulations governing the discharge of treated waste into a nearby river.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This includes reducing the phosphate levels in waste by ferric dosing and then dealing with the larger amounts of solids in the water created by the dosing by installing larger sand filters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three-person team typically has around a dozen sub-contractors on site at any given time. Work started onsite in October 2011 and is scheduled for completion in November 2012, one month ahead of programme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first CCS site inspection gave the team a score of 35.5/40. “We tried to get a feel from the inspector for what we should be looking at,” said Chilcott.  “We don’t have a lot of money to play with; we’re doing some work on local footpaths and have improved a bridle path at the side of the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We took material from the temporary car park and put that into the footpaths. That allows us to recycle the material and leave a legacy.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The site team looked at innovative ways to communicate with the neighbours and local community and decided to trial a site Facebook page to achieve this.  “The Facebook page allows two way communication with our stakeholders where any concerns can be raised and we can respond”.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>8 June 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The London Power Tunnels project for National Grid has reached another major landmark with the completion of the tunnel access shaft at the Pratt Street Site in Camden.  To mark this milestone, staff from across the project team hosted an open day with children from years 5 and 6 at Our Lady's Roman Catholic Primary School, which is adjacent to the site.<br /> <br />The children were given an insight into the role of National Grid, an overview of the project from the team including Costain and Skanska site engineers and were able to go onsite and see the 47m deep access shaft from a specially constructed viewing point. Additionally, the pupils enjoyed digging their own shafts during games set up in their school playground. Three large boxes were made and individually filled with sand, clay and gravel. Children in teams then had to try and sink a small shaft with trowels, then create an excavation, rather than just dig a hole, with some wooden blocks. <br /> <br />Commenting on the day, Moya Richardson, Associate Head Teacher at Our Lady's, said: "This was an exciting opportunity for our pupils to appreciate the variety of jobs within the construction industry. London Power Tunnels staff were able to enthuse and interest the children about the world of work and help them to see how relevant their current learning is. Our children loved visiting the site and looking down the shaft, as well as taking part in the hands-on activities. I would like to say thank you on behalf of our teachers and pupils for a brilliant day." <br /> <br />Moreover, London Tunnels Project Manager, Mat Ray, said: "It was great to give the children from Our Lady's the chance to see the exciting London Power Tunnels project that is going on so close to their school."</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>6 June 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Promanex, Costain’s support services business, has achieved ‘star status’ in the rough, tough world of rugby league.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At SSE’s power station in Ferrybridge, West Yorkshire, the team not only boasts a former rugby league international but also five semi-professional rugby league players who all run out for clubs in the West Yorkshire area, most notably for Featherstone Rovers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Featherstone Rovers, or Fev, currently play in the Co-operative Championship League, which it won in 2011, and they harbour big ambitions to play in the top-tier Super League by 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After first beating full-time professionals Castleford 21-16, Featherstone’s run in this year’s Challenge Cup came to an end when they were beaten 32-16 by the current holders, Wigan. However, they showed that semi-professional clubs like Featherstone, whose players all hold down regular full-time jobs, can still mix it with the richer, professional teams in the Super League.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Rugby league is a well-supported sport in this area and many of the teams and players maintain strong links with the local community,” said Dave Hobbs, a senior supervisor on the SSE team and an ex-England, Featherstone and Great Britain player with 14 international caps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Elsewhere, site transportation co-ordinator Stuart Dickens skippers Featherstone Rovers alongside team mate and trainee rigger Andy Kain. Fitter Waine Pryce has played for Jamaica at international level and plays for York City Knights, while welder Scott Wilson and fitter Danny Milton play for Nevison Rugby Club and Chequerfield Rangers Rugby Club respectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Promanex is a key contractor at Ferrybridge and employ around 25 people in trades such as fitters, welders, platers and riggers. The team provide round-the-clock support to ensure the plant is maintained to a high standard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bob Brown, the Site Manager, said: “We try to give employment opportunities to local players, who are all used to working in a team environment, and that really helps us with the work we do.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">31 May 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Princess Royal has performed the official opening of the UK’s largest energy-from-waste plant on the south bank of the Thames Estuary, formally bringing to a conclusion Costain’s successful involvement in the environmentally-friendly project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project, worth more than £300million, was known as Belvedere (after its location) for much of its construction period but is now formally titled the Riverside Resource Recovery Facility (RRRF).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It helps ease London’s waste problems by burning rubbish from the capital. The resulting heat produces steam that drives a 72MW turbine that generates electricity capable of providing power for 100,000 homes. Local waste from the Bexley area is also treated at the facility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although only now formally opened, the plant has been operational since last summer as the commissioning process continues. One of its green credentials is that the waste – around 2,500 tonnes per day – is brought downriver to the RRRF by barge. It is estimated this will keep 100,000 truck movements off local roads over the course of a year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s design and build contract at riverside included the huge major process equipment building, measuring 150m x 60m x 50m high, plus a 270m-long waste delivery jetty at which the barges berth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some 60,000m³ of concrete was needed for the project, which was recognised last year by The Concrete Society as the best Civil Engineering project in the society’s annual awards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s immediate client is Hitachi Zozen Innova, with Ultimate client Cory Environmental, which has “been very pleased” with Costain’s work, says Project Manager, Andy Mooney.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>30 May 2012</p>
<p>Costain has reached a number of significant milestones in the construction of three deep level tunnels as part of the London Power Tunnels contract for National Grid.</p>
<p>Costain is involved in the construction of 32 kilometres of 4.0mID and 3.0mID tunnels, 14 shafts, and four connecting tunnels with associated underground chambers. The team have so far completed 11 shafts and have achieved 750,000 man-hours RIDDOR free. RIDDOR stands for the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (1995) and is under the auspices of the Health and Safety Executive.</p>
<p>The tunnels are being driven by a 4.0mID Herrenknecht earth pressure balance (EPB) tunnel boring machine (TBM) and a 3.0mID CAT (Lovat) dual mode TBM from Canada, named respectively as Cleopatra and Evelyn by local schoolchildren.</p>
<p>Costain won the £220m contract in 2010 to build the new high voltage electricity cable tunnels between Hackney and Willesden (via St John’s Wood) and Kensal Green and Wimbledon. The new tunnels are essential for installing a safe and reliable electricity transmission network and to ensure London has sufficient transmission infrastructure to support future energy demand.</p>
<p>TBM Evelyn has dug its way to its first destination, a pre-prepared shaft deep below National Grid’s Channel Gate Road offices after beginning its journey from Willesden Substation earlier this year.</p>
<p>Evelyn is digging 19km of the 32 km London Power Tunnels project which will provide an easy to maintain underground electricity superhighway, while Cleopatra is digging the other 13km of the route and is approximately a kilometre away from her launch site in Haringey. Tunnelling work is scheduled for completion in 2014.</p>
<p>Commenting, Project Manager Andy Firth, said: “We are delighted to have reached these milestones for the London Power Tunnels. We are making good progress on this flagship project for National Grid which will help to meet London’s growing demand for electricity in the years to come.”</p>
<p>David Luetchford, the National Grid’s Head of Cable Tunnels, said: “The breakthrough represents another major step towards the completion of this vital project.  Our breakthrough at Channel Gate Road is just one part of a much bigger story which involves us deploying the best talent and technology available to help ensure the lights stay on.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">23 May 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has signed up to a health and safety accord designed to set standards for the offshore wind and marine energy sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The agreement was signed for Costain by Chief Executive, Andrew Wyllie, and on behalf of Gravitas Offshore, the consortium comprising Costain, Hochtief and Arup, by Managing Director, Environment, Alan Kay.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alan is a Director of Gravitas Offshore, which is proposing a concrete flask-shaped structure that sits on the seabed as a base for offshore wind turbines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is one of the first construction industry participants to put its name to the accord, which is sponsored by RenewableUK, the trade association for the sector: “We’re signing up to demonstrate our commitment to and support for health and safety excellence in the offshore renewables sector,” said Director of Renewables, Colin Duff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The accord was drawn up by RenewableUK and is the result of active engagement with key stakeholders including the Health &amp; Safety Executive and The Crown Estate, which owns the seabed inside UK territorial waters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, Colin reports good progress with Gravitas Offshore, with its base design having aroused considerable interest in the offshore energy industry.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">16 May 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ClerkMaxwell has secured framework agreements with four major North Sea operators with the potential value of up to £15million over the next three years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since Costain completed the acquisition of the Aberdeen-based upstream oil and gas consultancy in April of last year, the Company has gone from strength to strength, doubling its workforce to 100 people with plans to recruit another 30 engineers over the next three months.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Wilson, Managing Director of ClerkMaxwell, said: “The growth of the business over recent months confirms the impact ClerkMaxwell is making. The acquisition by Costain just over a year ago has helped continue ClerkMaxwell’s drive to being one of the leading front end engineering service providers in the upstream oil and gas market.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Graham Callander, Business Development Director at ClerkMaxwell, added: “Our ability to bring in detailed design and operational experience into the earlier phases of front-end projects is reaping rewards for the business. We have a team not only highly skilled in front-end activities, but also with extensive project delivery experience across a wide range of engineering disciplines.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frank Millar, Costain Hydrocarbons &amp; Chemicals Sector Director said: “ClerkMaxwell has doubled in size as we continue to focus on growing our presence in the upstream oil &amp; gas market. Our customers benefit from Costain’s full breadth of services across the hydrocarbons value chain and access to over 600 engineers from execution centres in Aberdeen, Manchester and Teesside.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">14 May 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Imagine having anything up to 20 projects underway at any given time. That’s the task facing the Costain team at London’s Heathrow Airport.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Local Project Integrator (LPI) under Project Director, Joe Kemm, a management team of 25 plus five supervisors tackles a range of projects from road refurbishment to repairing passenger terminal air chillers and installing security lighting to help keep the world’s busiest international airport running – “Anything to make the passenger experience better”, says Joe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Heathrow operates at around 99% capacity in terms of aircraft movements, so all work – airside or landside – has to be carried out with minimal disruption to airlines and passengers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain began work on the three-year LPI contract in April 2011. It normally tackles jobs individually worth up to £1 million, but one current project – refurbishing landside roads on the Airport’s outskirts – is worth £3.35 million and the team picked up £7.7 million of new work in the first quarter of 2012 alone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’re doing a lot of work at the moment to support the Olympic effort,” says Joe. Airport operator, BAA, understandably wants Heathrow looking its best as thousands of athletes and their support teams land in July.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Civil aviation is a highly-regulated sector, with many stakeholders, layers of approvals and safety factors to be taken into account demanding high quality workmanship, leadership and compliance to standards and processes. Joe says: “Costain is meeting these challenges and remains focused on performance so that they are exceeded”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One major current piece of work that contributes substantially to the Airport Sector’s £40m Heathrow turnover budget is the Complex Building Integrator (CBI) project, renewing baggage-handling facilities in Terminal 3. Security regulations require new baggage x-ray screening facilities to be in place by 1 September. This involves a Costain team replacing current scanners with eight, seven-tonne x-ray machines, each the size of a Ford Transit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Only two machines can be inoperative at any time. Associated conveyor belts, controls and power arrangements have also to be replaced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s a bit like keyhole surgery,” says Project Manager, Dave Johnson. His team has a six-hour window from 10pm-4am for ‘intrusive’ work such as replacing steelwork, but otherwise has to operate within a live baggage-handling facility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything has to be finished by 28 June, to cope with what is described as Heathrow’s biggest-ever ‘stress test’ as athletes arrive with all their equipment. The contract has increased hugely in scope and quadrupled in value but the completion date has remained unchanged. Which means that not only visiting Olympians will be racing for the finishing line this summer.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">10 May 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, as primary contractor on the Evaporator D project at Sellafield, has given its support to the town of Whitehaven in Cumbria to become a Portas Pilot, a Government backed initiative which aims to rejuvenate struggling high streets in England.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Large numbers of towns are vying to become Portas Pilots, with the 12 chosen each receiving advice from the retail guru Mary Portas and funding of up to £100,000 each to help regenerate their high streets and town centres.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Portas Review, published in December 2011, set out what she thought had led to the decline of the high street and made 28 recommendations about what could be done to breathe life back into them. She said many high streets had reached crisis point.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among the recommendations are for "town teams" to champion local high streets and business rate concessions for entrepreneurs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of their application, Whitehaven - the main town within the Copeland Borough - formed a Town Team and launched a supporting Youtube video which features local retailers outlining why Whitehaven should be chosen as one of the 12 pilots.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first round of applications closed on 30th March and the Government has said it has received “hundreds” of applications from across the country. The second round of applications closes on 30th June.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain currently employs around 100 people within the West Cumbria area and works with over 30 local subcontractors. In line with Costain Cares, its long-term operational initiative to address the growing needs of its stakeholders, the Company has backed the Whitehaven Town Team's bid to become a Portas Pilot town. Rob Phillips, the Project Director, submitted an official letter of support.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Costain has made a long-term commitment to the West Cumbrian area and we believe very strongly in regeneration and supporting the local community, therefore we are proud to back Whitehaven in its bid. We wish the team the very best of luck and will be on hand to offer any support we can,” said Rob.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stephen Murphy, Managing Director of the Guide Media Group (part of the Whitehaven Town Team) said: "Costain spend a lot of money in our area. To have their backing is fantastic. I really hope it helps tip the balance in our favour.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Luke Richardson, Costain Community Champion, added: “We wish the team the best of luck. The video is fantastic and it would be great to see Whitehaven become one of the 12 Portas Pilot Towns.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">9 May 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain announces its Interim Management Statement covering the period from 1 January 2012 to the current date, ahead of its AGM to be held later today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Overview<br /></strong>Following on from its strong performance in 2011, the Group is continuing to perform well and trading is in line with the Board's expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group is undergoing significant and ongoing transformation as a result of the successful implementation of its "Choosing Costain" strategy. That strategy is focussed on building the Group into one of the UK's top engineering solutions providers, delivering services for blue chip customers whose major spending plans are underpinned by strategic national priorities, regulatory commitments or essential maintenance requirements in chosen sectors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A core component of this has been the broadening of the skills and capabilities across the full asset life cycle demanded by our customers. Consequently, the services we now offer to our customers, and the composition of our earnings, are being transformed as we continue to broaden the business through the implementation of our strategy. Currently 25% of our 2012 order book now comes from support services activities and this will continue to grow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this context, Costain in 2011 made two acquisitions both of which have been successfully integrated and are providing a broader range of opportunities for the Group. The enhanced capability provided by Promanex enabled the Group to win a £60m operations and maintenance contract from new customer the Oil &amp; Pipelines Agency earlier this year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Order book<br /></strong>We have continued to secure new orders and extend existing contracts and the order book currently stands at £2.4 billion, of which over 90% is repeat orders from our blue chip customers. In addition, the Group has preferred bidder positions of circa £400 million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To date over £800 million of revenue has been secured for 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The level of tendering activity in the Group's targeted markets of Infrastructure, Environment and Energy &amp; Process is high.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pension<br /></strong>As reported earlier this year, as part of the ongoing management of the pension scheme, the Group completed the transfer of two PFI equity investments valued at £20.3 million into The Costain Pension Scheme. Additionally, the Group has made an Enhanced Transfer Value and Pension Increase Exchange offer to the members, and this process is due for completion later this month.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Financial Position<br /></strong>There has been no material change in the robust financial status of the Group, which continues to have a strong net cash position of in excess of £100 million, and has no significant borrowings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Dividend<br /></strong>As announced with the preliminary results, reflecting another successful year and our continuing confidence in the long-term prospects for the Group, the Board is recommending at today’s AGM an increased final dividend of 6.75 pence per share (2010: 6.25 pence per share). This brings the total for the year to 10.0 pence per share (2010: 9.25 pence per share), an increase of 8%.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Outlook<br /></strong>Whilst market conditions remain uncertain, the Group has strong financial resources and is delivering on its clear strategy. Accordingly, the Board remains confident of meeting its expectations in 2012 and is committed to delivering its ambition of doubling profits in the medium term.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">8 May 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Costain graduate has developed a radical new way of working and underlined his Company’s major drive on innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While working as a Site Engineer on the award winning £90million Church Village Bypass Scheme, for Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council, James Bulleid noticed that an electronic tagging system could potentially save valuable time and effort in the cataloguing and tracking of plant equipment and tools.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Having studied a module in supply chain management at university I was aware that a technology called radio frequency identification (RFID) was used in the food industry to track stock as it moved between depots, and  I thought there must be similarities between the logistical nature of the food industry and the challenges we face in construction,” said James.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">James spoke with Barry Woodman, his Project Manager on Church Village, about a range of ideas from tracking bulk deliveries to locating small hand tools using tracking technology, and about how RFID could be successfully implemented.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“James’ enthusiasm and persistence was crucial in us adopting the RFID technology. It has allowed us to have more control over our on-site plant and equipment which has contributed strongly to a best practise approach in how we manage that equipment,” said Barry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">James met with Bill Hewlett, Costain’s Technical Director, and Tim Embley, Costain’s Group Innovation and Knowledge Manager, who helped to define the business case for the innovation, as well as offer advice on seeking further information in bringing the idea to fruition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the support of the team, James refined the initial concept of applying RFID to construction into a stores management system with a detailed plan and business case outlining the return on investment. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lance Woodman, a Stores Assistant on the Church Village project, commended the innovation, which has reduced the amount of paperwork required to process information and the time spent sourcing equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It used to be endless form filling but now we simply go to the website, download the data and it’s right there in front of us.  This has proved that the technology does work once you get people sufficiently comfortable with using it and I believe there’s scope to expand it right across the business,” said Lance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The refined RFID innovation was used on the Church Village Bypass and has subsequently been transferred to the Port Talbot Harbour Way project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting, Tim Embley, said: “James has demonstrated all the skills to successfully implement innovation and add value to the services we deliver to our customers and I’m pleased to say I see this determination and drive for innovation right across our business.” </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bill Hewlett added: “We are transforming Costain to provide our customers with game changing technical solutions.  James’s story reflects the importance of innovation in our businesses and how we, as a Group, can provide valuable guidance and support in how to progress an idea.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">3 May 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has become the first construction company in the UK to achieve BS11000 status.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Being awarded the British Standard for Collaborative Business Relationship Management Systems, means that an organisation has demonstrated that it accurately assesses both itself and potential partners in terms not just of technical attributes but cultural ‘fit’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s longstanding ‘team player’ approach to doing business with companies made it an ideal candidate for the standard, which was only introduced in autumn 2010.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company decided to adopt BS11000 partly because of its increasing network of relationships with major clients and supply partners and partly because it realised that the new standard chimed closely with the Choosing Costain strategy, said Business Improvement Director, Tony Blanch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We already achieve 80-85% of BS11000; it’s embedded in the culture,” said Tony who, together with Business Improvement Manager, David Sanders, oversaw the process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The award “demonstrates to clients that an independent third party agrees that we do what we say we’ll do when it comes to collaborative business relationships”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Assessors from BSi visited three locations to check that Costain met the necessary requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Maidenhead they examined how Costain looked at collaborative opportunities and checked that the necessary processes were in place. They then visited the recently-completed Bidston Moss Viaduct strengthening project to assess how Costain had managed relationships with its partners there. Finally, they put the Reading Station modernisation job under the microscope, looking at Costain’s relationships with structural steel provider Bourne Steel and cladding specialist Lakesmere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The BS11000 certificate is due to be formally presented to Costain at the House of Lords in mid-May.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">3 May 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Members of Costain’s supply chain were given an insight into the future when they attended the latest conference designed to foster closer alignment between them, the Company and their peer group.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fourth in the series of events – now dubbed the Strategic Partners’ Conference and held at roughly 18-month intervals – took place at Warwick University in late April, attracting some 150 representatives from Costain’s supply community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was renamed this year to reflect the increasingly mature nature of Costain’s relationships with its suppliers, said General Manager for Procurement and Supply Chain Management, Martin Orrells, who hosted the event.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is one of the major events of the Costain year,” he said – a comment borne out by the presence of some 50 senior Costain personnel including no fewer than five Executive Board members plus Managing Directors Darren James, Alan Kay and Charles Sweeney and all the Company’s sector and commercial directors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The suppliers’ representatives heard a series of presentations from Costain’s top echelons on subjects ranging from collaborative working and the Company’s work-winning plans to a summary of the successes achieved on the Bidston Moss Viaduct strengthening job, plus an introduction to the Costain Cares and managing performance programme. The event also provided an opportunity to recognise the efforts of four high-performing companies, which were presented with a mounted certificate acknowledging their achievements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A question and answer session with Executive Board members gave the supply chain representatives an opportunity to quiz them on the Company’s future strategy, prospects and issues that challenge the industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Feedback from the audience had been very good, said Martin: “They found it an excellent way of getting an insight into Costain’s strategy, what it valued, what it wanted and the stuff that excited the Company. By interacting with senior management they learned first-hand a lot about our business.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>2 May 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain delivery team handling the infrastructure framework contract with Northumbrian Water has won a significant contract to build a new duplicate raw water main from an existing intake point at Ovingham on the River Tyne, west of Newcastle, to Horsley WTW.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new main will supplement the existing 35-year-old 1400mm diameter GRP main. It will be 1200mm diameter and constructed of ductile iron, each section being  8.1 metres in length.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The route of the new main will predominantly take it through farmland, crossing five existing strategic mains on the way, two of which the new main will tap into. This will give Northumbrian Water increased flexibility and security within its network with regards to the movement of raw water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The rural nature of the job will make logistics – notably getting individual lengths of pipe-work, each weighing 4.1 tonnes, to the working site – challenging, says Costain Framework Manager, Ben McCormac. The Costain team and its suppliers will have to adhere strictly to the route to minimise disruption to farmland.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An important aspect of the project is that it is at the higher end of the value range of contracts the Company handles under this framework, which got underway in March 2011 and will last for four years, with the possibility of up to six further years in contract extensions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new contract is “A good boost for morale and a great opportunity to develop our relationship and demonstrate to the client what we’re capable of” says Ben.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work on the new main is due to start in June and be completed in early 2013.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">1 May 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has again made its mark in the annual Considerate Constructors Scheme awards, with four sites operated by the Company, either itself or as part of a joint venture or consortium, taking Gold Awards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These included awards for two separate parts of the Cleaner Seas for Sussex scheme for client Southern Water as part of the 4Delivery team – the project’s Infrastructure and Peacehaven Wastewater Treatment Works. It also struck gold on the A40 Penblewin to Slebech Park Improvement project and the M53 Bidston Moss Viaduct Strengthening job.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Silver Awards went to Newbury Parkway; Prendergast Vale School, Lewisham; Bond Street Station Upgrade (Costain Laing O’Rourke jv) and the A1 Black Cat to Sandy Street Lighting Renewals (Lafarge Costain jv).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rounding off the merit list were Bronze Awards for Arkwright Street and Longley Lane sites on the Greater Manchester Waste project; Pontypridd Town Centre Regeneration; Port Talbot PDR Phase 2; Prendergast Hilly Fields school, Lewisham; Fawkham WSW (4Delivery); M1 J10-13 Improvement Scheme (Costain-Carillion jv); Thameslink Farringdon Station (Costain Laing O’Rourke jv) and Crossrail Royal Oak Tunnel Portal (Costain Skanska jv).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From over 8,500 eligible sites, only the highest scoring 7.5% were presented with National Site Awards under the Considerate Constructors Scheme. Registered sites were monitored and scored on their level of consideration, and an independent panel reviewed all eligible sites to decide whether they had reached the standard required to win an award.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">30 April 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has strengthened its Power Sector team with the appointment of Ian Graves as Director where he will be responsible for harnessing Costain’s collective expertise from across the Group for the benefit of its customers in the Power Sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ian previously worked at Promanex, which Costain acquired in August 2011, and will lead all activity across the Group in the Power Sector, including Renewables, Transmission &amp; Distribution and all aspects of Power Generation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reporting to Charles Sweeney, the Managing Director for Energy &amp; Process, Charles said: “Ian brings with him a wealth of experience from across the industry in both the public and private sectors, and his drive and ambition strengthens our operation as we look to build on our presence in the Power Sector.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prior to joining Promanex, Ian held senior roles in Midlands Electricity, which is now part of Western Power, and E.ON, including positions in networks, generation and a secondment to Government at the Department of Energy and Climate Change.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ian’s appointment is in line with Costain’s Group strategy of Meeting National Needs, which aims to deliver a full-service offering to its customers, from front-end engineering consultancy and design, through construction to the care and maintenance of a customer’s assets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Significant capital investment is needed in the power sector as the UK seeks to decarbonise its economy and ensure that capacity is available to help deliver future economic growth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Government's energy policy objectives are ambitious. In order to cater for increasing energy demand, achieve the decarbonisation of the electricity sector by 2030 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050, the Department of Energy and Climate Change estimates that in excess of £100 billion needs to be invested in the energy sector by 2020.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ian said: "I am delighted to be leading the Power team at such an interesting time for the industry. I am keen to accelerate the development of a broader range of Costain engineering solutions, as our customers seek to find partners capable of supporting them during the next phase of their investment programmes and beyond.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ian has an honours degree in electrical engineering from Sheffield University and is a Chartered Engineer. He is a Fellow of both the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET) and the Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE). He is also an alumnus of Manchester Business School and Cranfield School of Management.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">25 April 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Neil Grinham, a third year graduate engineer employed by Costain and who has worked on South Wales projects at Church Village and Rhydyfelin in Rhondda Cynon Taff, has received a top award from the Civil Engineering Contractors Association (Wales).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the second year in succession a Costain graduate engineer was awarded the CECA Wales Most Promising Trainee Civil Engineering Award.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rhodri–Gwynn Jones, a Director of CECA, said: “CECA Wales is once again proud to have sponsored the ‘Trainee Engineer of the Year’ Awards 2012 and it was very fitting that the award itself was presented by the Welsh Government’s Deputy Minister for Skills, Jeff Cuthbert AM. His support and commitment and that of the Welsh Government to the training of new entrants into civil engineering industry is crucial if it is to survive and prosper into the future. CECA extends its gratitude to all member companies who provide the necessary opportunities to encourage new entrants and provide training opportunities, particularly in the current economic climate."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In assessing the awards, CECA Wales sought evidence of the candidates’ development and potential and their capacity and hunger for the tasks ahead of them. Neil fully matched these expectations and is indeed a worthy winner in 2012.<br /><br />Thomas Kenyon, Site Agent for Costain, said: “Neil is wholly deserving of the award. His dedication and determination to challenge the norm and promote innovation within the business whilst always being committed to his role with the upmost efficiency and professionalism, singles him out. Suffice to say the Costain team is very proud of his achievement."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Neil Grinham said: "I am really pleased to have received the award and perhaps most important is the encouragement and support I have received from all at Costain. I have an exciting and fulfilling career and look forward to supporting and delivering high quality projects with Costain."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The winner of the award last year, James Bulleid also of Costain, has been shortlisted for the Construction News Awards 2012 in the category of ‘Rising Star of the Year’. </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">23 April 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A group of top Costain Graduate Trainees presented ideas on business development to their CEO Andrew Wyllie last week, at the Investec offices in the City of London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Trainees, 29 in total, were asked to produce presentations on how Costain could enhance its business in the future.  The Graduates were split into five teams and the presentations were made to Andrew Wyllie accompanied by Tony Bickerstaff, Finance Director and Tracey Wood, Company Secretary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Few companies give their Graduate Trainees the opportunity to present direct to the CEO on business development. The initiative highlighted Costain’s focus on innovation and the continual drive to promote change and improvement through every facet of operation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Andrew Wyllie said: "The presentations were first class and several of the ideas will now be looked at in detail and potentially become new areas of business for the Costain Group. In terms of skill, knowledge, focus and enthusiasm, Costain has some of the best Graduates in  industry...this event was confirmation of that fact.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">19 April 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s industrial services division, Promanex, has won a health and safety award for helping a site achieve 500,000 man-hours RIDDOR free during the first phase construction of a waste to energy combined heat and power plant in Runcorn, Greater Manchester.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RIDDOR stands for the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (1995) and is under the auspices of the Health and Safety Executive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Promanex won the award for contributing to the overall number of incident and injury free man-hours achieved during the first phase of the project. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keppel Seghers is constructing the plant on behalf of Viridor Waste Management for the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority (GMWDA) and will provide an integrated solution for the 1.3 million tonnes of municipal waste the Authority handles each year.  Work has started on Phase Two which will treat an additional 375,000 tonnes of solid recovered fuel per year derived from household waste.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Ninety per cent of our work involves working at height - from scaffolding, cherry pickers or platforms - which increases the potential risk of an accident. We are therefore delighted to receive this award and I would like to thank everyone involved on this project for their great attitude towards health and safety and their excellent workmanship during the job,” said Mark Dixon, Sector Director, Costain Industrial Services.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain team working on the PDR scheme in Port Talbot* received national media coverage recently when BBC Radio 4 and BBC News online visited the site in South Wales to investigate the community benefits of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following a visit by Welsh Government Minister for Finance, Jane Hutt, the BBC featured the project on Radio 4’s “File on Four” as well as their online news service. Harbour Way was held up as an example of how public service contacts could be won by not just looking at best price, but by incorporating a community benefit plan including job creation and economic regeneration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Project Manager, John Skentelbery, said: “To have a prestigious programme like File on Four take an interest in the project for the work we are doing for the community of Neath Port Talbot is a fantastic boost, not just for the scheme, but for the people who are working on the PDR too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">”To be applauded for the extra work we are doing goes to show there is more to construction that just building objects and helps to improve the image of our industry.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*The PDR scheme includes the construction of a bridge over the Swansea to London railway, railway realignment and signalling works and a new main entrance into Port Talbot Tata Steelworks.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">17 April 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is pushing ahead with preparatory work on its contract to improve the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in South Wales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working on an Early Contractor Involvement basis, outline design of the 8km stretch of road is underway, with draft orders planned for publication next February. A public enquiry is likely to be required late summer 2013. If all goes according to plan, Costain will commence work on site  in February 2014 for the 2.5-year construction programme. Halcrow, Atkins and RPS are developing the scheme design for Costain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’re in there to make sure it’s a buildable design that gives good value to the customer,” says Project Director, Barry Woodman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As its name suggests, the route links the northern ends of several valleys. The aim is to widen and improve transport links and aid regeneration of the area, which is an unemployment blackspot. The route has been split into six sections, with several contractors working on individual sections.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is responsible for Section 2, which climbs up from from Gilwern, near Abergavenny, to Brynmawr.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This section is one of the most challenging parts of the whole A465 road programme, says Barry. From the technical viewpoint the route has to be widened where it passes through a challenging mountain gorge, which will make careful traffic management crucial. Particularly significant on this scheme, however, is the array of environmental issues that the team has to handle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of Europe’s biggest populations of lesser horseshoe bats, Wales’s only substantial tract of ancient beechwood and one of Europe’s largest limestone cave systems all have to be sensitively accommodated within or adjacent to the scheme. Protected geological features and several industrial heritage sites, such as the Clydach Iron Works, also have to be taken into consideration along the route.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">12 April 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A team from Costain’s Water Sector, with client Severn Trent Water, worked round-the-clock to secure the supply of water to 100,000 customers in the Hereford area after a serious leak at Severn Trent’s Wyelands Intake Pumping Station, near Ross-on-Wye, last month.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The incident happened on Wednesday 8 March as Costain carried out routine maintenance at a pumping station that pumps raw water to a water treatment works 5km away.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the team worked on the station, a 900mm diameter flange joint ruptured which released water at high pressure. With pressure inside the piping system set at 25 Bar, the chamber flooded and required urgent round-the-clock support and assistance from Costain, including a team from Costain Industrial Services, Severn Trent and numerous suppliers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pressure in an average household water main is normally set at around 3 Bar which gives some indication of the amount of pressure going through the water main at the pumping station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working together, the team drained the 5km main containing the water, removed the leaking valve, and recharged the affected pumping main so it could restart pumping again by the morning of Monday 12 March.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Not only did we have to repair the leak, which was a massive job in itself, but we also had to make sure that there was enough water in the reservoir to allow time for the repair to be completed before we turned the pumps off. A special repair piece was fabricated by one of our suppliers overnight on the Friday and that gave us enough time to complete the repair without emptying the reservoir. The dedication and teamwork from all concerned was first class and averted a potentially serious supply issue,” said Matt Crabtree, Costain’s Water Sector Director.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting, Kate Vickers, Production Manager at Severn Trent Water, said: “The excellent team working between Severn Trent Water and Costain allowed us to complete a complicated repair and avoid any risk to customer supplies.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">10 April 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A year on from its acquisition by Costain, oil and gas upstream engineering consultancy ClerkMaxwell is seeking to expand considerably the portfolio of services it offers the marketplace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group’s backing of the Aberdeen-based organisation has enabled it to raise its sights and aim for larger projects than those for which it would previously have envisaged bidding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the past year its size has roughly doubled to 80 personnel and further staff expansion is anticipated as it continues to grow. It currently has engineering offices in Manchester and Teesside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’ve gained four new clients and turnover is up 60% over the past year, but to move us on to the next level we need to move in to the Engineering  Procurement and Construction (EPC) side,” explains Business Development Director, Graham Callander.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The ideal next step would be a long-term framework arrangement with a major oil company where ClerkMaxwell is responsible for all the front-end studies, detailed design activities and construction associated with the customer’s assets,” says Graham. Bids are currently lodged for two such framework contracts, with the successful tenderer due to be announced later this year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having Costain as a backer makes a difference, adds Graham. Although the Group has not had a significant presence in Scotland in recent years it is remembered as a major EPC contractor on some major oil and gas industry projects there. For this reason, ClerkMaxwell’s planned expansion into new areas may be better characterised as a re-entry rather than a new arrival.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Having Costain’s scale behind us acts as an enabler to get through the door and gives us enhanced credibility,” says Strategy &amp; Growth Director, Alistair Dornan.  “It’s given us corporate backing that we wouldn’t have had a year ago,” agrees Graham.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ClerkMaxwell has no plans to lose its focus on consultancy and front-end services despite its intentions of broadening the scope of its activities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among these plans, it aims to expand beyond its traditional North Sea marketplace. The North Sea market is currently “busy but delicate”, says Graham and output is on a steady decline. Despite the high headline figure of a barrel of oil, a significant percentage of the value of each barrel extracted goes to the Government. On top of that, much of the infrastructure was placed in the testing conditions of the North Sea some 30 years ago and maintaining it costs increasingly large amounts of money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ClerkMaxwell has already done a number of front-end studies for international projects and this is “a good solid trend”, says Graham. “You’ve always got to work to expand your global footprint and that’s something we’re keen to do. The majority of our customers are international businesses and look to us to support them.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">10 April 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The winners of this year’s Sir Albert Costain Memorial Awards received their prizes at the AGM of the Company’s 21 Club.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The awards are nominated by project managers, or other senior personnel, for having shown particular successes in their training. The awards comprise a £250 cheque and a certificate marking the recipients’ achievement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The awards are named after former Chairman Sir Albert Costain, who placed great importance on training for staff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first of this year’s winners was Bryan Williams, who had been working on the <a href="/choosing-costain/waste/case-studies/riverside-resource-recovery-facility,-belvedere.aspx">Riverside Resource Recovery Facility</a>, at Belvedere, as a Trainee Foreman and has since moved to Bond Street.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adding to a successful year by taking another of the awards was James Bulleid, who in February was named Trainee of the Year in the Company’s Achieving Excellence Awards.  James made mention of the fantastic support he had received from his mentor, Martin Burdes.  The third award went to Sophie Tuckett, who is training to be QS on the ‘Cleaner Seas for Sussex’ <a href="/choosing-costain/water/case-studies/brighton--hove-waste-water-treatment-scheme.aspx">Brighton and Hove waste water treatment scheme</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the most experienced people in the British construction sector gathered at London’s Oval cricket ground for the event. Around 140 people attended the AGM, followed by a dinner at the venerable sports venue. Among them were many members of the Costain Executive Board, including Corporate Development Director, Alex Vaughan, who formally represented the Group. Also attending were other senior figures including Peter Costain, the last member of the founding family to run the Company and Tyrell Wyatt, past chairman of Costain and WS Atkins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 21 Club is open to any staff member who has completed 18 years with the Group. Membership  currently stands at around 700.  Chairman, Richard Hucker MBE, said he was delighted so many members attended each year and that senior managers take the care to nominate such exceptional trainees for the awards.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">3 April 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain teams working on two Severn Trent Water sewerage improvement schemes have shown local residents how the works will improve the service both to them and to the environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Residents and the local press were given a tour of the £4.5million project to improve facilities at Worcester Sewage Treatment Works (STW). This is divided into four schemes covering processes such as new sludge dewatering and handling facilities and will provide several benefits including improving handling capability and the replacement of malfunctioning equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Severn Trent’s Customer Operations Manager, Gaynor Jerzyszek, joined the group’s visit. “We received some very positive feedback, which was encouraging, and I feel that opening the site up was a big step forward forging positive relationships with the people that really matter: Our customers.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Site Agent, Andy Mountford, added: “It was good to be able to meet some local residents and demonstrate the positive effect our scheme will have on this site. I think they all left here with a new-found appreciation of the vital role that the sewage treatment process plays in their local environment.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, at Severn Trent’s nearby Kerswell Green site, Costain’s Site Manager, Tops Akomolafe, and Commissioning Engineer, John Forster, showed another group of residents the progress made on installing a Rotating Biological Contactor (RBC).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When operational, this will allow Severn Trent to replace the daily emptying by tanker of a communal septic tank, a practice that has led to odour problems, significant wear and tear on a shared stone access track and numerous complaints from residents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new RBC will see waste treated and discharged through the existing outfall pipe rather than being chemically treated and pumped to Kempsey Sewage Treatment Works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tops said that feedback from tour members had been good, with the only outstanding concerns being the visual impact of the works: “We’ll look to address this as part of completing our landscaping.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John added: “This is the first time I’ve been this closely involved in customer care. It was great to be able to show people what a difference the scheme is going to make to them.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">2 April 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has completed the strengthening and refurbishment of the 730-metre long <a href="/choosing-costain/highways/case-studies/implementing-lean-construction--m53-bidston-moss-viaduct-strengthening.aspx">Bidston Moss Viaduct </a>on time and under budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project, which entailed strengthening 3 km of box girder structure dating back to 1969, required 1.25 million man hours and was achieved without a single lost time accident.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Located on the Wirral in North West England, the Bidston Moss Viaduct carries the M53 over local roads and a railway line towards the Kingsway Tunnel and Liverpool. Over 50,000 vehicles use the viaduct on a daily basis, including 3,000 heavy goods vehicles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Weight restrictions were imposed on the viaduct in 2005 as a safety precaution. In order for it to remain open and viable, the structure’s weaknesses had to be addressed by 31 December 2011 or it risked being closed to HGVs. The scheme was funded by the Highways Agency, the Department for Transport, Wirral Council and Merseyside Integrated Transport Authority (Mersey Travel).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Strengthening work started in April 2010 and was completed in September 2011, three months earlier than planned, which allowed the restrictions on HGVs to be removed.  The refurbished bridge was formally handed back to its three owners defect free on Wednesday 28th March 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcoming the completed project, Roads Minister, Mike Penning said: “The Bidston Moss Viaduct is on a major route for the Wirral and into Liverpool, so we’re delighted that the strengthening work was completed three months earlier than planned – providing additional lanes for heavy goods vehicles. This early completion also helped the Government save £1.5m.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mike Penning added: “Heavy goods vehicles can now travel in both lanes, helping to ease congestion for everyone who uses that section of motorway. This can only be good news for the regular commuters and those who depend on good transport links for transporting goods and services in the region.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As well as the strengthening works, the £88.5m scheme included concrete repairs to the underside of the viaduct and repainting of all the steelwork. The road has also been resurfaced, lighting has been upgraded and drainage has been improved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting, Graham Dakin, Project Manager at the Highways Agency, said: “The strengthening was vital to the future safety of the viaduct and the refurbishments will allow the thousands of people who travel over it every day to continue to use it in the decades to come. Lean ways of working, such as factory style production control and process improvements helped to reduce the programme and save over £1.5m on the total spend.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The scheme received numerous awards and recognition for its industry leading key performance indicators. The team achieved record scores in its Project Performance Assessment (PPA), which covers safety, leadership and stakeholder management, and the project’s excellent health and safety record was rewarded with three Gold RoSPA Awards during the life of the contract.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Simon Ellison, the Costain Project Director for the scheme, attributed its success to excellent levels of engagement and communication across the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Genuine collaboration and a ‘one team’ approach have underpinned everything we’ve undertaken. Everyone involved is rightly proud of what has been achieved,” said Simon.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">30 March 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s drive to expand the services it offers customers has achieved a notable milestone with the award of its first waste and energy consultancy contract.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The agreement, worth up to £0.75 million in fees, is for client Enviroparks and is to provide a renewable energy park for Hirwaun, South Wales, where a mix of municipal, commercial and industrial waste will be prepared into a fuel from which electricity will be generated. The local planning authority is Rhondda Cynon Taf Council, within whose area Costain has a high reputation after undertaking a series of road contracts in recent years.  Crucially, the council has already given planning permission for a waste plant on the site, with a view to it being operational in the 2014-15 timeframe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is the first pure waste and energy consultancy contract for our waste sector, in line with our ‘3 Cs’ strategy – Consultation, Construction and Care,” said Business Development Director for Waste, Mark Huddart.   “Our client has recognised and valued the skills that we can bring to his team to help convert this major scheme into reality.  We beat off some formidable competition to win the contract.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has been engaging with the market to enable Enviroparks to finalise an integrated technology selection and there are expectations that when the energy plant – potentially worth £170 million – is built, Costain will be employed to undertake work beyond its professional services contract.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is an exciting prospect,” explained Mark. “While assisting Enviroparks to develop the scheme on paper, we could also build the facility and then be involved in its care and maintenance for the foreseeable future.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One aspect of the proposed plant is the extensive work undertaken to minimise the environmental impact of the project, making it as attractive as possible to the local community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Enviroparks and Costain are proposing an environmentally advanced plant that would use gasification of waste-derived fuel as the main process.  Gasification is a process which reacts the fuel at high temperatures (&gt;700°C), without combustion with a controlled amount of oxygen.  The resulting gas mixture is called syngas which is in itself a valuable fuel that can then be used to power a conventional steam generator, or, after cleaning, power a gas turbine, gas engines or be fed into the national grid.  The proposed plant would accept up to 240,000 tonnes of waste annually to be converted to a fuel which produces around 20MW of electricity to the grid – enough to power the equivalent of 20,000 homes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the electricity generated from the waste by this technology is from non-fossil fuel it attracts ‘renewable obligation’ funding via OFGEM, which adds to its attraction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Importantly, when the project is built it will generate up to 200 jobs in the local area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We started work with Enviroparks last year,” said Mark. “Everybody has huge ambitions to do this as quickly as possible, but we have to ensure that the concept is correct. Enviroparks are ‘technology-agnostic’, so they’ve asked us to work with them in a fully integrated and highly collaborative manner to choose a technology that’s both fundable and will provide an economic solution for the long-term future of the project."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next phase will be completion of the design, logistics and planning necessary to finalise the  project  funding, before then moving into engineering, procurement and construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Enviroparks, he added, “has ambitions to roll this out elsewhere in the UK.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are delighted to be working with Enviroparks on this scheme, providing innovative renewable energy solutions and contributing to our national energy needs.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">27 March 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s *MAC 10 Project, M62, J9 to 11 Improvement Works has excelled in the latest results released by the Considerate Constructors Scheme (CCS).  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project was awarded a total score of 37 out of a possible 40.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the CCS measuring a total of eight categories, the MAC 10 Project received the maximum score possible, an impressive 5 out of 5, for both the safety and the environment categories, showing that exceptional measures were taken in line with the scheme’s requirements. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The CCS monitor commented that: “Regular toolbox talks are carried out.  Operatives are encouraged to make safety suggestions.  The site has introduced safety innovations developed through lesson learned / operative suggestions” and that “Attention to detail regarding site safety is first class”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project was also awarded a score of 4.5 out 5 for each of the remaining six categories: considerate, appearance, a good neighbour, respectful, responsible and accountable.  This score showed that a ‘high level beyond compliance’ was achieved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In summary, the monitor remarked that: “The site team are running a compliant site under the Considerate Constructors Scheme in a professional manner.  The site gives a good impression and the whole team fully embraces the scheme requirements”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The MAC 10, £9.5million scheme combines three sets of improvements into one ‘rolled together’ scheme including the widening of the link roads from the M6 at junction 21A (Croft Interchange) onto the M62 eastbound carriageway at junction 10.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Croft Interchange is one of the busiest junctions on the motorway in the North of England with the M62 at this point carrying 57,000 vehicles a day in each direction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Gerard Ward, Site Manager at MAC 10 commented: “There is always a great sense of achievement to get a great score especially when you know the high standards expected from the CCS.  The team’s response to delivering a much needed improvement scheme for the local community will be impressive and extremely welcomed by the local community.  It is important that High Profile Highway Schemes are given some recognition with hopefully a modest Award to hang up alongside the Silver achieved last Year.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Neal Symmons, Highways Agency Service Delivery Manager for this scheme stated: “Achieving a CCS score of 37 out of 40 is an excellent score and reflects the efforts of the entire project team.  The linear nature of highway network projects mean our work areas are large when compared with other construction projects, this fact coupled also with our customers travelling through our works area means our constructions teams have to be extra vigilant and work very hard to achieve CCS scores of this level.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*MAC 10 is an A-one+ Project, which is a Joint Venture Project with Colas and Halcrow.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">26 March 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has passed another milestone in its major school-building programme in Lewisham, south London, with the topping-out ceremony at Bonus Pastor Catholic College.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ceremony was attended by the Mayor of Lewisham Sir Steve Bullock and the parish priest of Downham, Canon John Kavanagh. Bonus Pastor is the fifth school in Costain’s portfolio of 10 projects in the borough under the Building Schools for the Future project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ceremony, although billed as a topping-out, took the form of a plaque-laying in what will be the chapel of the 750-pupil school. In fact, Costain is already significantly into the secondary school’s construction programme, with around eight weeks to go until practical completion. It is due to be formally opened in May 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new Bonus Pastor College is split over two sites and is being built in the playgrounds of the school’s existing premises. When the new buildings are complete and occupied, the old premises will be demolished and the playgrounds reinstated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three-storey buildings consist of concrete frames with clad facades. The project is aiming to achieve a rating of Excellent for BREEAM sustainability; they will have ‘green’ and ‘brown’ roofs. The former will be covered in grass, while the latter will feature crushed recycled rubble.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both schools back on to a woodland walk and Costain has been co-operating closely with Lewisham council’s Ecology Manager and school on a series of biodiversity measures, including the placement of bat boxes around the sites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among hurdles faced by Project Manager, Clive Kraus’s, team has been the location of the two sites in residential areas. This has led to restrictions being placed on vehicle movements in and out of the site at some times of day to minimise disruption to local householders and pupils moving between the two school sites during the day.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>23 March 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A new sensor to detect movement in structures is being used on the Costain/Laing O’Rourke jv at Bond Street Underground Station in central London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The wireless sensor, from London company Senceive, instantly flags up any concerns to a remote supervisor. Peter Wright, now Associate Director, Tunnels, of Halcrow Group, part of the Halcrow Atkins design group on the project, introduced the devices to the jv team at Bond Street, which is now using them to monitor London Underground infrastructure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Halcrow are working with Costain/Laing O’Rourke, London Underground and Senceive to develop this technology,” said Peter. “Being able to deploy it in a live environment has allowed us to advance traditional construction techniques and improve the way we deliver the project efficiently in a challenging environment.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I’m particularly pleased at how this innovation has been deployed to benefit the project; the team has been able to advance the development of this technology, in particular the user interface and post-processing of data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“However further developments will further enhance the functionality of the system and in collaboration with Cambridge University’s Innovation and Knowledge Centre initiative and with further funding, this technology can be further developed and extended into new and exciting applications of remote monitoring.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has already taken an interest in similar sensors, known as ‘motes’, which send alerts about the movement of a structure. Those emerged from Cambridge University’s Centre for Intelligent Infrastructure and Construction Centre. Costain has a substantial investment in Cambridge University, helping fund research relevant to its needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Costain Group Innovation Manager, Tim Embley, the Senceive sensor complements the motes and Costain is collaborating with Senceive to look at different solutions that will enhance area remote monitoring capability. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The man implementing the Senceive sensors’ use at Bond Street is Senior Engineer, James Brookfield. They are being used to monitor the tunnel lining during the grouting that is taking place as part of the Bond Street Station Upgrade contract.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Senceive monitoring system has enabled us to mobilise the monitoring in a very short period of time at the start of the shift when time is at a premium,” said James. “It has also allowed us to monitor in real-time, which was an important feature of the grouting methodology.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain/Laing O’Rourke jv team has been sufficiently impressed with the sensors’ performance to date that it has leant its support, along with London Underground and Halcrow, to Senceive’s attempts to source more funding to develop further its product.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Remote monitoring is an important service we are providing to our customers,” noted Tim.  “It reduces costs compared to traditional methods and allows our teams to remotely monitor assets safely during construction and through the life of the asset.  Remote monitoring is all about providing intelligent solutions to our customers to enhance their business performance.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>20 March 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A team from the Brighton &amp; Hove WWTW project led by Project Manager, Graham Sugrue, is taking part in this years’ ‘Tour of Flanders’ cycling event.  The aim of the event is to raise money for a charity called Project Moz.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cycling event takes place in Belgium on 31st March.  The team will ride the programmed route as the pros will do the day after.  There are steep climbs and cobblestones which the team will have to overcome on the 90 mile ride.  The team consists of Graham Sugrue, Phil Ebner (Costain Graduate Mechanical Engineer), Matt Crabtree (Customer Director), Paul Hutton (Graduate Civil Engineer), Mick Lippard (Sales Manager, Speedy Hire), Warren Mitchell (Senior General Foreman) and Aalok Sonawala (Business System Manager) and they aim to complete the ride in seven hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The funds raised will be used to support an IMechE volunteer project that Phil Ebner is leading.  The team of young engineers have volunteered to design and build an irrigation system in Mozambique.  The IMechE has close links with a charity called Project Moz which is currently building an orphanage for a local community in Mozambique.  Through this charity the IMechE Young Members Panel identified a project to design, procure and install an irrigation system for 2 hectares of farmland in the same community.  Phil and his team have identified and narrowed the scope of the project, completed concept designs, carried out detailed research on Mozambique and the local community, identified local suppliers and ascertained an estimated cost of installation.  The irrigation system will involve a new borehole/well, pumping systems buffer tanks, filter processes and the irrigation pipe work. The challenge is to raise £25,000 for the project by October 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The cycling team has had an excellent response in support from various stakeholders on the Brighton and Hove project, however we are still a long way from our fundraising target. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Brighton &amp; Hove project is currently completing the construction, installation and commissioning of a Wastewater Treatment Works and Sludge Recycling Centre on the south coast of East Sussex for client Southern Water. The team consists of members from Costain and its sub contractors working on the £300 million waste water treatment works project.<br />If you would like to support this initiative or make a donation, please contact <a href="mailto:phil.ebner@costain.com">phil.ebner@costain.com</a> or donate via the virgin giving site <a href="http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/team/projectmozirrigation">http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/team/projectmozirrigation</a></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>19 March 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Environmental Services aims to increase its areas of expertise over the coming year as it seeks to boost both turnover and profit margins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The business – known until last year as Geotechnical Services – is broadening its portfolio as it follows the Group’s remit of expanding the range of services it offers clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Leading the change will be new Operations Manager, Paul Clough, who took over the day-to-day running of Environmental Services from Phil Parsons at the end of January.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His first task was to confirm the new name; on his appointment he found a variety of titles being used, reflecting its switchover last year from Geotechnical Services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s been a bit ad hoc implementing it so far,” he says. The name-change is now being instituted in areas such as document templates and e-mail signatures, with more expensive facets, such as altering the livery on the division’s vehicles, to come later.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paul, previously Construction Manager at 4D, the framework contract on which Costain works for Southern Water, says the Bourne End-based business is already expanding from its traditional specialities of geotechnical services and materials testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’re moving into areas such as waste consultancy and geo-environmental studies, which involves monitoring nuisances such as noise and dust. We’re also expanding into such things as instrumentation and monitoring – we’ve won a job recently at Paddington Station to install inclinometers and other sensors measuring alignment and displacement in the huge box that is being dug for the new Crossrail station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Historically, our geotechnical services and materials testing have been highly regarded and we fully plan to support those businesses, but in terms of profitability we do see other markets as more beneficial. Some of the margins, particularly in materials testing, are tightening.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He aims to build on the esteem in which the division’s traditional services have been held, while continuing the drive to improve service delivery. With even internal customers – Costain’s project managers – putting the type of work handled by the division out to tender, “We need to ensure we’re on those tender lists and become the natural choice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’ve made leaps and bounds in customer satisfaction over previous years, but there are always improvements to be made.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His priorities for the coming year, he says, are to boost both turnover and profit margins.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Over the past year we’ve been trying to grow the business organically. People have been coming in from other parts of the business and now that we do have these new business streams on board we have to start getting the work through the door.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the long term, he does not rule out external acquisitions to expand the business further.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We need to make ourselves unique. The plan for the long term is we’re aiming for a one-stop solution for customers, from Early Contractor Involvement onwards.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>16 March 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has embraced Lean Engineering Principles (Lean) to deliver significant cost savings for its customers, and teams from across the Group are transferring what they have learnt on various projects, through the internet, to improve further the performance of the business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Being Lean means creating value for the customer by cutting waste and making the best use of the resources that are available. Lean Principles have been used in industry for a number of years as a way of establishing a continuous improvement culture, removing waste and making operations more efficient. This approach has become increasingly important for the construction industry as customers face tighter budgets while under increasing pressure to deliver a quality service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Highways Agency has worked closely with its supply chain over the last three years to increase the use of Lean Principles in order to get the most out of the country’s strategic road network (SRN).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, which maintains around one-third of the motorways and major A-roads in England on behalf of the Highways Agency and often in joint operation with other contractors, used Lean Engineering on the M53 Bidston Moss Viaduct Refurbishment Scheme for the Agency.  Built in 1969, the 730 metre long, 37-span steel box-girder structure had deteriorated with time.  With a very tight budget, as well as an extremely complex programme, Lean was vital for the success of the project. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using Lean, Costain strengthened the structure and returned it to full capacity three months early and realised over £2.8 million in cost savings on the £90 million project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adam Bennett, a Project Systems and Performance Manager on the Scheme, said early engagement with the customer and employing a fully integrated supply chain was crucial to its success.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Using Lean Engineering, we were able to deliver key milestones ahead of schedule and under budget while exceeding customer and stakeholder expectations. We achieved this by employing a Collaborative Planning System which enabled the teams to deliver the same amount of work but with fewer resources,” said Adam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Through enhanced communication processes and removing any blockers to progress, a ‘Lean Culture’ was embedded which focused all parties on maximising efficiency. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lean now forms a major part of the Agency’s procurement process and was recognised by the Government in November 2011 when the Agency was shortlisted for an Achieving Better for Less Award at the 2011 Civil Service Awards. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The M53 Bidston Moss refurbishment project clearly demonstrated how the deployment of Lean results in improvements in delivery in terms of cost, quality, time and safety. The team are to be commended on the way they have deployed lean and the positive culture it has engendered throughout the supply chain. The willingness to share this experience/knowledge with the rest of the industry has also been impressive," said Sue Housley, Lean Technical Manager at the Highways Agency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has embraced Lean Engineering and it has also recognised that it shouldn’t be confined to any one team, sector or division.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a result, the Company has sought to transfer the lessons learned from the use of Lean across the business via online webinars. This has been crucial in allowing people to contribute to and learn how to apply these principles in order to get the best results for the customer. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tim Embley, Group Innovation and Knowledge Manager, said: “Lean is about cutting waste and being more efficient with the resources you have. We are focused on sharing the knowledge we have gained and harnessing it for the benefit of the Company and our customers who are under increasing pressure to cut costs.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain holds regular Lean webinars for any interested party to dial-in to.  Further details can be found within the Knowledge Centre or by contacting members of the Lean Strategy Group led by Tony Blanch, Costain Group Business Improvement Director.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>14 March 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The proposed Heysham to M6 Link Road Scheme in Lancashire has reached a significant milestone after the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) formally accepted an application for the Scheme to be examined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is engaged on the Scheme in an early contractor involvement arrangement on behalf of Lancashire County Council. The £123 million Scheme includes a 4.8km stretch of dual carriageway running from the A589 between Lancaster and Morecambe, to an upgraded Junction 34 on the M6 and includes a new bridge over the River Lune.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The examination process, which will take six months, is due to begin in late March. At the end of the examination period, the IPC has three months to make a recommendation to the Secretary of State who will then make a final decision on whether to approve the Scheme. If approved, construction on the Scheme is scheduled to start in summer 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project team includes Lancashire County Council, Costain, Jacobs and law firm Bircham Dyson Bell. All parties were involved in the application, which also notched up three firsts for the project:</p>
<p>• The first application for a highway scheme<br />• The first application made by a local authority<br />• The first to be accepted in less than three weeks</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">County Councillor Tim Ashton, Cabinet member for highways and transport, said: "The M6 Link is more than just a road - it will be an engine for economic growth for the whole of the region and we're very pleased that we have been given the go-ahead to move on to the next stage.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since March 2010, it has been a legal requirement that all Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs) receive consent from the IPC. A project is deemed to be nationally significant if it meets certain criteria, in this case the alteration of the slip roads to the M6 motorway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The IPC is due to become part of the Planning Inspectorate in April 2012 but all applications with respect to nationally strategic or major infrastructure projects will remain unchanged.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under the Planning Act 2008, other local authority highway schemes may be considered nationally significant and will therefore have to go through the same process. As a result, the Heysham team is now sharing what it has learnt from the new planning process with other highway schemes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is a major achievement for the whole Heysham to M6 Link team as the approval process is extremely rigorous and it’s no surprise that there have only been 13 applications to the IPC in nearly 18 months. We have proved the advantages of a totally integrated team approach to delivery of an application on this major highway scheme,” said Andrew Langley, Costain Project Manager.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>13 March 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain-Laing O’Rourke Joint Venture working on the major Bond Street Station Upgrade project in central London for London Underground is pioneering a solution to a longstanding construction industry problem – working off old versions of plans.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The potential of the new system is so great that software developers are now considering introducing it to new versions of their products.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Engineers working on sites have long been aware of the problem that can arise if managers make a decision that results in amendments to drawings.  Those amendments do not always find their way immediately to front-line staff, especially where there are already multiple revisions of that drawing. This can result in work being done according to an outdated construction drawing, resulting in site personnel having to re-do the work, increasing costs and delays to the programme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although there have been attempts to solve this problem in the past, they have usually involved cumbersome manual systems involving signing individual documents in and out.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Graduate Engineer Tom Jamieson, working as a Site Engineer at Bond Street, masterminded a new system to eliminate this problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I had a discussion with Senior Engineer Beth Willoughby about innovations on site and using technology on the front-line; one idea she had was using Quick Response (QR codes to control the issuing of drawings.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jamieson took the idea of using QR codes – the square digital pattern of thousands of tiny black and white blocks that act as a more modern form of barcode and which can be ‘read’ by any modern phone such as a BlackBerry or iPhone that has an inbuilt camera and internet capability – and set up a trial system last November that used a new code for each iteration of drawings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When each drawing is printed, a unique QR code is generated.  When scanned, the QR code directs the user to an external website.  This website is connected to the document management system.  When each drawing is scanned, a clear statement is sent back to the phone in either green or red. Green text confirms that it is the most up-to-date version of a drawing, while one with red print carries a statement warning that it has been superseded by a more recent version.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As further safeguards, the code on each drawing carries additional information including a version number, the date on which it was created and name of the person who uploaded it into the system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Results of the trial were sufficiently promising that three sections of the Bond Street contract are due to start using the new plans. From April, piling subcontractors Bachy Soletanche will have all their drawings issued with QR codes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It definitely has potential,” said Jamieson, “There seems to be a lot of talk about it in the industry, about getting it in as a standard tool.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Currently, there’s nothing in place that stops people using an incorrect drawing on site; there’s a gap there that can be closed and the feedback I’ve had from senior engineers is that this technology can fill that gap.” “Tom did a fantastic job,” said Willoughby. “He’s done several surveys on site  to determine the percentage of frontline supervisors that are used to smartphone technology and whether they’d be willing to take part in an on site trial.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a result of the favourable results from the Bond Street trial, Costain now plans to introduce QR coding on drawings for the £400 million remodelling of London Bridge Station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One lesson learned from his efforts, added Willoughby, was that it was quite difficult to put QR codes into the drawings at Bond Street simply because the drawing producers were not obliged to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With that in mind, “We’ve put that into the work scope for the designers at London Bridge so it’s an integral part of their job.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The benefits of using QR codes for this purpose has been realised further afield, reports Group BIM Manager Matt Blackwell.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“What we’ve been doing on Bond Street has been recognised by software providers as beneficial and innovative to the industry as a whole. They are seeking to implement it in future releases of their products.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">12 March 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s  Eamonn Slevin is the winner of this year’s James Rennie Medal Award, following the annual event at the Institution of Civil Engineers’ (ICE) London HQ on March 1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The award brings both the prestige of the James Rennie Medal as well as a £1,000 prize. It is named after the man who in 1930 became the ICE’s youngest member and spent 70 years in the profession.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To give some idea of the scale of Eamonn’s achievement, the event is open to all engineers who gain Chartered status over the preceding year. In 2011, some 1,100 achieved this and the ICE initially picked a shortlist of 12 before narrowing that down to just three finalists.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eamonn’s rivals were Nikolaos Socratous, a Structural Engineer with Arup Associates and Tom Wilcock, a Senior Engineer with Arup.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Eamonn, who is Construction Manager on the M53 Bidston Moss Viaduct Strengthening Scheme, presented and defended his Chartered Professional Review project report on the viaduct to a four-strong judging panel and audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It was an overview of the project and some of the challenges I encountered,” said Eamonn, who admitted to some trepidation at presenting his project report. “Even though I carry out monthly briefings to large numbers of staff and personnel I found it a little nerve-racking.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Bidston Moss project involved strengthening the viaduct on The Wirral that carries the M53 motorway over a railway and roundabout. The 730m-long, 37-span steel box-girder structure dates back to 1969. Like many bridges of that construction method and vintage, structural updating was required to remove the BD79 weight restrictions and monitoring regime.  Without the refurbishment works the viaduct faced closure, a move that would have had considerable economic repercussions for the Liverpool area. The BD79 restrictions were removed three months early and the scheme is due to handover ahead of programme before the end of the month.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The necessary strengthening saw 600 tonnes of steel installed inside 3.7km of box girders. The project was also notable for using 2,800 tonnes of scaffolding and containment – the largest scaffolding installation in the UK at the time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among the challenges faced by Eamonn, who was also Temporary Works Coordinator, were the risks of working at height given the huge amounts of scaffolding involved and the logistic challenge associated with large numbers of people working inside the confined surroundings of the box girders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain was one of the four sponsors of this year’s award. "Costain was delighted to sponsor the 2012 James Rennie Medal Award because its aims resonate so well with our target of developing our people,” said Darren James, Managing Director, Infrastructure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Darren is himself a previous holder of the James Rennie Medal, winning the inaugural competition in 1996. Simon Ellison, Project Manager on the Bidston Moss project, won in 2007.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">8 March 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, one of the UK's leading engineering solutions providers, announces that it has been awarded a three-year asset support contract for the operation and maintenance of the Government Pipeline and Storage System.* The contract is expected to have a value over three years of approximately £60m, and has the potential to extend for a further two years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group was awarded the contract by the Oil and Pipelines Agency (OPA), which manages the Government Pipeline and Storage System and six Royal Navy oil fuel depots on behalf of the Ministry of Defence. Under the terms of the contract Costain will be responsible for asset management and capital project delivery in addition to operations and maintenance of the entire network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As well as bringing to bear Costain’s skills and capability in engineering, construction and project management, the operations and maintenance experience of Promanex, which the Group acquired in August 2011, was instrumental in securing the contract.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive of Costain, commented:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>“The award of this contract by a new customer demonstrates the value that Promanex has brought to Costain in providing the full life of asset services in high growth market sectors. It also marks an important stage in the ongoing transformation of the Group as we continue to broaden our service offering, both organically and by targeted acquisitions.”</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>“Our strategy of focussing on major customers whose spending plans are driven by national need, regulatory commitments or essential maintenance requirements continues to deliver results. We look forward to working with the OPA to ensure the safe, cost effective and efficient operation and maintenance of this strategic national asset.”</em></strong></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">6 March 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With predictions of drought conditions hanging over much of England for the coming summer, Costain is helping keep water flowing to industry and residents in the West Midlands.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Draycote Reservoir, Warwickshire, normally receives some of its water intake by pumping it from the River Leam, 10 miles away. However, low rainfall over the past two years has meant that water levels in the Leam have left the usual abstraction point uncovered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To replace the flow, Severn Trent Water asked Costain to create a new link between the river and reservoir as swiftly as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We worked on a number of drought alleviation schemes for Severn Trent in 2011 but early this year we received this emergency job for Draycote,” said Simon Roberts, Costain’s Delivery Manager for the current AMP5 Framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Severn Trent had the kernel of the idea on 11 January and we were involved two days later. We started work on 30 January with an integrated team consisting of Costain, Severn Trent Water and our designers MWH.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s work involved connecting to an existing facility that normally pumps to Leamington Spa, then running 1km of temporary plastic pipework to link in to an existing pipeline. The plastic pipework was butt-welded every 12 metres and lies above ground, except for the points at which it goes underground to join the existing pipe and the abstraction station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now operational, the new pipe will deliver up to 10 million litres of much-needed water a day to Draycote Reservoir.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under AMP5 and AMP6 framework contracts, Costain is handling work for Severn Trent until 2020.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">5 March 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Terry Tomlinson, Costain Energy &amp; Process Front End Solution Manager, recently joined a panel of experts to present at the Carbon Capture and Storage Forum held in London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other speakers at the conference included prominent industry stakeholders from Shell, National Grid and SSE. The keynote speaker was Adam Dawson, Chief Executive of the Office of Carbon Capture &amp; Storage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The conference focussed on how large scale carbon capture and storage can become a commercial reality. Costain’s conference paper addressed the challenges facing the industry in implementing the ‘next generation’ of carbon capture technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last year, Costain was commissioned and funded by the Energy Technologies Institute (ETI) to undertake the design of a pilot plant capable of capturing 95% of the carbon dioxide emissions from a coal-fired power station. Following front end design, Costain will build, operate and test the carbon capture pilot plant by the middle of 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A diverse portfolio of low carbon <a href="/choosing-costain/power/meeting-the-need.aspx">power</a> generation capacity is at the heart of the UK’s energy security strategy. Coal fired power generation is part of that mix but new facilities will need to incorporate CCS in order for them to be built and operated in the UK. It is expected that all new-build coal-fired power stations will require CCS capability by 2020.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Terry Tomlinson said: “Costain’s team of front end specialists has developed an innovative CCS technology that will reduce capital cost requirements, significantly improve overall plant efficiency and achieve a high carbon capture rate in excess of 95%.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The UK is at the forefront in developing the next generation in carbon capture technology that will make CCS technology viable for generations to come,” added Charles Sweeney, Costain Energy and Process Managing Director. “In line with our strategy of Meeting National Needs, we have the opportunity to help significantly reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that is produced by coal fired power stations.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>29 February 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A small water treatment works in Gloucester has beaten many larger projects in the latest set of results released by the Considerate Constructors Scheme (CCS).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The initial visit by the CCS monitor to Severn Trent Water’s (STW) Chalford Water Treatment Works saw the Costain team achieve a score of 35.5 out of a possible 40, healthily exceeding Costain’s internal target of 34 and just short of reaching the top 10% of sites nationally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of the eight areas measured by the CCS, the team achieved the highest mark possible in the categories of Safety and Responsibility. This demonstrates that exceptional measures were being taken in these areas. All other areas measured achieved either four or 4.5 out of five, showing a ‘high level beyond compliance with the scheme’s requirements’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The CCS monitor commented that Chalford was “a well set-up and managed site“. He added that there there was good co-operation between Costain and Severn Trent Water and was impressed with the use of ICE (In Case of Emergency) hard hat stickers containing relevant medical and contact details.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These, for example, list any pre-existing conditions that an individual may have, such as diabetes or epilepsy, which could be of vital assistance to a first aider in the event of an accident.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The monitor also remarked on the effect of the new text messaging service for ‘near misses’, which had seen a 600% increase in reporting levels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Severn Trent Water is investing £1.4 million to upgrade and improve Chalford Water Treatment Works, which currently provides drinking water to around 23,000 customers in a series of small communities around Stroud.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The work involves replacement of pumps and control gear, which at over 30 years old are coming to the end of their working life. The upgrade will also see a number of safety improvements for operatives managing the site to help reduce operational costs over the long term.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Site Agent, Chris Vice, said: “This is a great initial score that the site team should be proud of, especially seeing it is such a small project. We are now looking forward to improving our score during CCS’s second visit.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Water Customer Director, Matt Crabtree, added: “This is a fantastic result for a small project, and highlights the efforts made by the team to build relationships with our customer.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>28 February 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Technical Director, Bill Hewlett, addressed leaders from Government and the construction industry on aspects of the industry’s future at a prestigious London conference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The invitation-only event, ‘Innovation In Construction’, was co-Sponsored by the Royal Academy of Engineering, the University of Cambridge's Centre for Smart Infrastructure and Construction, and the Institution of Civil Engineers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bill put forward his thoughts on several areas including procurement, disruptive innovation and engaging society with the construction industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Focusing on procurement of the construction stage of projects, he asked why some projects ran according to plan but others went awry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He argued that the answer lay in the degree of project complexity; building a straightforward office block meant that not only could components be fully defined, but also the time likely to be required to construct the building. A basic building was a defined product that could be built for a lump sum and with a fixed end date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, applying this approach to a complex project would fail. Such projects – where it is not practical to know within an acceptable risk profile all the factors that could affect the project at the time the contract is signed – were much less easy to define.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By way of example, he profiled our experience of rail station refurbishment in London. There, it is recognised from the outset that problems could arise and these are duly accommodated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The complexity of dealing with the unrecorded aspects of Victorian construction, in a highly-sensitive work environment, is recognised at the time of procurement; in consequence, a proactive approach to risk share, including progressive design development and Building Information Modelling definition, is put in place.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He welcomed the appearance of new funders for construction projects – notably two groups of pension funds with which the Government had recently signed a memorandum of understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the procurement approach had to match the complexity of the individual project: “My concern, looking ahead, is that we need to make sure that the new funders procure with this in mind. My experience of acting as a builder in the PFI market is that private funders have seldom chosen to share construction risk with the builder.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With this in mind, the new funders had to be directed towards more interactive forms of procurement. “They need to set about procuring in a way that the risk is managed to deliver best value to the project.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Turning to engagement between the construction industry and society, he asked his audience if it was possible to replace ‘Nimby-ism’ with eager engagement. This would avoid costs and delays that often stemmed from mistrust.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the industry was quite good at engagement, the correct approach is vital, particularly in sensitive areas such as the Green Belt or rural districts. “If you go out protected by process and legality, it looks like you are going out for a fight and you’ll get one. A more human engagement can open up very different possibilities.” Again, he was able to draw on Costain’s portfolio to demonstrate best practice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the event Bill summed up: “This was a high profile event at which I was proud to be able to promote the great work we do at Costain, and the great way we do it – my thanks to everyone across the Company who does it.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">27 February 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is closing in on obtaining a new quality standard, as it approaches the final stage of the certification process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">British Standard 11000 (BS 11000) is designed to acknowledge expertise in Collaborative Business Relationships. A new standard, having only been announced in autumn 2010, only a few companies have so far qualified for it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain hopes to be the first to do so in the construction and engineering sector, says Business Improvement Director, Tony Blanch, who, together with Business Improvement Manager, David Sanders, is handling the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s all about how you work collaboratively, both upwards with customers and downwards through the supply chain or in joint ventures.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To achieve BS 11000 certification a company has to demonstrate that, rather than simply starting to work with another organisation that it firstly assesses itself and determines what type of other organisation it wants to work with.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This, says Tony, involves considering more than purely technical attributes but also the ‘culture’ of a potential partner, to see if it will be a good ‘fit’. A gap analysis is then undertaken, to determine whether there are any areas in which the two companies’ attributes do not join up and if those gaps can be bridged.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s a case of carefully selecting a partner,” explains Tony, "rather than simply thinking, ‘We need to work with someone, who can we work with?’”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As well as carefully considering the factors necessary to achieve a good link, an important facet of BS 11000 is also planning an exit strategy from the partnership.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He likens the connection between two companies who agree to partner each other to “a dimmer switch, not an on-off switch. You decide how much information you want to share; do you give your partner access to your own intranet, for example?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BSi assessors carried out the Stage 1 assessment for Costain’s BS 11000 application in late January, which showed that Costain’s approach meets the standard. The second and final stage of assessment will take place in April, when demonstrable evidence of collaboration working will be presented, after which certification will hopefully be granted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain decided to undertake BS 11000 partly because of its increasing network of relationships with major clients and supply partners and partly because it was realised that the new standard chimed closely with the Choosing Costain strategy. “It’s almost a no-brainer, so why not have external verification?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“As the primary purpose of the standard is for the partners to add value to each other’s operations,” says David, “it supports perfectly our ambitions of continually delivering enhanced value for our customers.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">23 February 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, one of the UK’s leading engineering solutions providers, today announces further actions taken to manage the obligations in the legacy Costain Pension Scheme (the ‘CPS’).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Board has agreed with the Trustee of the CPS to transfer the Group’s interest in a portfolio of two PFI investments into the CPS, at an agreed valuation of £20.3 million. This represents an effective discount rate of circa 7%. As a result of the transaction, the accounting profit realised on the transfer of the assets is £10.2 million in 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, as part of the package of measures being implemented, the Group has instigated a liability risk management exercise. The Group is in the process of issuing Enhanced Transfer Value and Pension Increase Exchange offers to the members of the CPS. These initiatives, which potentially include every member of the CPS, will offer each individual greater choice and flexibility regarding their pension entitlement, and will also reduce the overall pension liabilities and risk remaining within the scheme. The level of liability reduction will depend on the take-up of the offer by members and financial conditions at the point the entire exercise completes (expected to be May 2012). At this stage, it is estimated that the initiatives could reduce the scheme liabilities by approximately £50 million, and could incur a one-off accounting cost, estimated at £6 million, to be expensed in 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Together, the above actions are estimated to reduce the pension deficit by approximately £16 million, with an associated potential reduction in annual deficit contributions, following the next triennial actuarial valuation of the CPS which is due as at 31 March 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />Notes:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. The two PFI assets transferred into the CPS are:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Integrated Bradford Holdco Two Limited<br />Lewisham Schools For The Future Holdings 2 Limited</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. The gross asset value as at 30 June 2011 of the two PFI investments transferred was £7.5 million (31 December 2010: Nil) after the IAS 39 mark-to-market swap adjustment and £8.9 million (31 December 2010: £0.2 million) excluding this adjustment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The profits attributable to the two PFI assets for the six months to 30 June 2011 were £0.2 million (for the twelve months to 31 December 2010: £0.1 million).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. The IAS19 gross deficit in the CPS as at 30th June 2011 was £35.8 million.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">22 February 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Chris Walters, and his Corinthians teammates, completed their Atlantic Ocean Rowing Challenge in 48 days, eight hours and three minutes, beating their own target by nearly two days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In what is billed as the world’s toughest rowing race, the team set off from San Sebastian de la Gomera, in the Canary Islands, on 4th December 2011 and rowed 2,645 nautical miles – or over 3,000 regular miles – to finish in Port St Charles, in Barbados, on 22nd January 2012. With storms and 40 foot waves, many boats ended up travelling a lot further.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the sixth day the team was in the lead but problems with its steering mechanism restricted progress and it was unable to make up for lost time once the problem was rectified.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“That particular breakdown, and there were a few, really knocked us back because we had to steer the boat manually and it limited the number of people we needed to row the boat,” said Chris, a plumber for Promanex, Costain’s industrial services division, based in Devon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team survived on desalinated drinking water generated by on-board solar panels and a diet of high calorie compact food packs, but the biggest challenge the team faced was sleep deprivation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We survived on less than three hours sleep a night, which can really play tricks on the mind. Trying to focus on the task of rowing while being constantly wet, caked in salt and rowing in mid-30 degree daytime temperatures really added to the discomfort and exhaustion,” said Chris.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chris added: “It was like the worst caravan holiday you could imagine but with torture thrown in. It really tested us mentally and physically. We trained for it at home but no amount of training can truly prepare you for what it’s like on the open ocean. We wanted to complete it within 50 days so we’re very happy.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The four-man team was the oldest team in the history of the competition, with fellow crew member Tony Short the oldest competitor at 66.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team continues to raise money for two charities; Shelterbox, which provides food parcels for people affected by natural and man-made disasters, and the British Heart Foundation.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">21 February 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the recent National Apprenticeship Week, Costain’s Environmental Services Director, Andy Bull, and three young apprentices, Ross Olney, Sam Marshall and Osman Farooq, swapped jobs for the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was Costain’s first involvement in National Apprenticeship Week which has run for the past four years, and reflects our growing emphasis on an Apprenticeship being a valid route of entry into Costain Group and the industry as a whole. During 2011 we recruited 20 new apprentices and hope to increase this number across the whole Costain Group in 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the morning, Andy was instructed by the three apprentices on how to carry out various experiments in the Geotechnical materials laboratory and really enjoyed himself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The apprentices then accompanied Andy to Head Office, where they attended a Commercial Review meeting and gave a presentation to some of the senior <a href="/choosing-costain/environmental-services/meeting-the-need.aspx">Environmental Services </a>team including Paul Clough, John Richardson and Andy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After the event Andy commented:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I found real value in the job swap. I would recommend it to other managers and will be planning further similar sessions.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>20 February 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Outstanding young Costain personnel have an opportunity to be recognised for their efforts as the Group’s 21 Club prepares to present the annual Sir Albert Costain Memorial Awards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Project managers and other senior staff have until the end of February to submit nominations for the Awards, which are given to young Company members who have recorded particular achievements in training.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Three awards are given, each giving the recipient a £250 cheque plus a certificate recording their success. The Awards will be handed over at the 21 Club’s AGM and annual dinner at the Kennington Oval cricket ground, on 30 March.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Awards normally attract around 20 to 30 nominations,” said 21 Club Chairman, Richard Hucker MBE, a Senior Estimator. “Three of the Club’s senior members then sit down and sift through the nominees to arrive at the three winners. Since we don’t know the candidates, we are totally reliant on the citations made by managers to build up a picture and make a fair judgement.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Awards were initially targeted at apprentices, in the days when Costain employed many craft workers. Over the years, their scope has widened to include anyone acquiring skills under a Costain training scheme. This year, it will also be open to eligible personnel from the Group’s newly-acquired businesses, ClerkMaxwell and Promanex.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We know the Group is investing heavily in training and that many young people demonstrate dedication, commitment and extraordinary progress from the training offered,” said Richard. “This is a chance for three of them to gain recognition for their efforts.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 21 Club was originally set up for staff who had achieved that number of years in the Company’s service. The eligibility level is today 18 years and the Club has around 700 members, of whom 150 or so usually attend the AGM and dinner – including many of the past and present Company’s Executive Board.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>16 February 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain Team, working on the Dwr Cymru Welsh Water (DCWW) Framework, is celebrating again after exceeding five years without a RIDDOR (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This remarkable milestone was reached recently and has seen over 2.2 million manhours worked without a RIDDOR over the five years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Madden, Framework Director said: "To reach the five year mark without a reportable accident is a wonderful achievement for the whole team. Our impressive safety record highlights the continued commitment to health and safety by all Costain staff on the Framework and throughout our supply chain”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team continues to promote safety awareness through numerous incentive schemes across its projects. John goes on to say: “However, continual focus has to be applied in order to maintain this record and this year Costain Behavioural Safety (CBS) will remain the primary initiative to aid the Framework’s drive for continual improvement”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Framework intends to appropriately mark this milestone with all the Costain Framework staff and supply chain who have contributed to this superb safety achievement.<br /><br />Ends</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>15 February 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During 2011 the Greater Manchester Recycling &amp; Waste (GMRW) Project recorded in excess of 1.7 million man hours without a lost time accident or incident.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to this the GMRW Project – which commenced in the Spring of 2009 - has now worked a total of over 5.5 million man hours and has twice reached well in excess of 1 million man hours without a RIDDOR, Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Project Director, John Boyd, commented: “To have worked over 1.7 million man hours in 2011 without a RIDDOR is a remarkable achievement for the team, especially when you consider the number of separate sites that have been in operation and the nature of the construction and commissioning activities that have been carried out. I am very proud of the efforts that have been put in by all members of the team in ensuring that everyone went home safely at the end of their shift throughout the year. ”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John went on to explain: “The Construction and Process teams work closely with Health Safety &amp; Environment, Manager, Des Roy, in fully engaging with the workforce. We have based a good deal of our safety philosophy in engaging with our supply chain, which we have done through a variety of mechanisms including behavioural based approaches.” </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We strive for a zero Accident Frequency Rate, (AFR) but we recognise that there is always more that we can do,” says Des. “We have tried very hard to embed safety into the way we do things and a zero AFR is just one way of measuring this. Through education and encouragement, we have ended up with a good number of our subcontractors voluntarily engaging with safety. We operate and implement our SHE systems to a very high standard, but to achieve true success you need the buy in and the teamwork from all concerned.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">14 February 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Costain project, part of the Lewisham Building Schools for the Future framework, has embraced modern social networking and opened a Twitter account to improve further communication with neighbours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Victoria Yates, Site Manager, said: “We’ve been doing the normal monthly newsletter drop and we also have a community notice board on our site hoarding with photos of the site and other information, but we thought we could be doing more to keep the local residents and wider community informed. The site team had a chat and we decided to open a Twitter account.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alan Neal, Construction Manager, said: “Twitter is such a well known and well established networking site it was easy to set up the account. The framework is already there so all you have to do is upload a photo and provide a comment whenever anything interesting is happening, so its not time consuming for us to manage. We’re been followed by the Costain Group and also the school we are building for. It's hard to see a downside!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The site announced the new communication method on the latest newsletter and also produced a poster for the hoarding for passer-by to get the details.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">13 February 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The A-one+ road maintenance joint venture (jv), of which Costain is part, is funding a hard-hitting radio advertising campaign to alert drivers to the risks of driving into coned-off work zones.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The series of three advertisements superimposes the sound of a rapidly-approaching vehicle over the sound of typical workplaces – one of them, a busy office. Screams of staff can be heard as the vehicle seemingly crashes into desks, horn blaring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The advertisement voiceover then says: ‘If a car went ploughing through your workplace, you’d be shocked. But, for the workers who keep our roads in good order, the road IS their workplace.  So the next time you’re tempted to run a red light or ignore a reduced speed limit, think about them. Think about their families.’</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Breaches of workzones have become a weekly occurrence, says Stuart Cordier, Operations Director at A-one+. The causes vary, but regularly include drivers falling asleep at the wheel, motorists blindly obeying satnav instructions that take them straight through lines of cones, drunk drivers and sheer impatience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’ve had a number of accidents with lorries hitting traffic management vehicles,” he says. “We had a serious one this year – luckily nobody was hurt, but we were getting more and more concerned about the situation.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Drivers tend only to see cones on the road, rather than realise their significance – that they are there to protect road workers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A-one+ has provided significant funding to pay for 520 advertisements over two weeks on commercial stations Real Radio and Smooth Radio in the four regions – Northeast, Northwest, East Midlands and Yorkshire where the jv handles roadworks for the agency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is the first time the jv has funded such advertisements, but research has shown that when previously broadcast in other areas they have helped improve driver recognition of the problem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s just to try to make people think,” says Stuart. “If that was your workplace and you were sitting at your desk, would you be happy with a 40-tonne lorry coming past at 56mph?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A-one+ comprises Costain, Colas and Halcrow.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">6 February 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is lending its weight to National Apprenticeship Week, which runs from 6-10 February, with the publication of a case study, in conjunction with Business in the Community (BITC) and City &amp; Guilds (C&amp;G), explaining its commitment to apprenticeships and detailing the successes of some of those who have taken up this form of employment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The case study has been produced for the launch of the BITC and C&amp;G ‘Million Extra’ initiative, which aims to bring together employers, training centres and learners to deliver a million Apprenticeships by 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s case study includes testimonials as to the value of apprenticeships from managers as well as from past and present apprentices. Among the former group is former apprentice Mike Field, who last year became the first Technician Fellow of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the Company has traditionally made an investment in an annual intake of graduates, in 2010 it began also to invest in an Apprenticeship Development Programme to help offset the UK construction industry’s skills shortage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Recruiting apprentices enables us to meet our future skills needs in crucial areas,” said Apprenticeship Manager, Val Thompstone, who is responsible for the programme. “It allows us to recruit the right people and develop them in a way that meets the needs of both Costain and the apprentice.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Programme was formalised two years ago when 21 people were recruited on to an Advanced Apprenticeship Scheme, which seeks out talent in fields such as civil engineering and design rather than traditional ‘craft’ sectors. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, it also covers areas such as business administration, accountancy and laboratory technicians. The Energy &amp; Process division recruits in a wide range of subjects including civil/structural design, instrument, and piping design.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Places are highly sought. “Response last year was fantastic,” said Val. “We had around 40 applicants for each position.” The commitment of applicants can be seen from the fact that only two have dropped out. Costain currently has 33 apprentices on the payroll (six having completed last year) and hopes to recruit up to a further 30 this year, depending on demand from the business. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The three-year apprenticeship is designed to culminate in the apprentices gaining Level 3 BTEC and NVQ diplomas. The end point in professional development is membership of the apprentice’s relevant professional institution, such as the ICE.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apprentices can gain their qualifications either via a mix of day release courses or an online ‘e-portfolio’ together with on-the-job training. Some attend block release at college during their first year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One fan of the Advanced Apprenticeship scheme is Environmental Services Director Andy Bull: “My division recruited five Technician apprentices in 2011; we have been delighted with their work ethic, enthusiasm and commitment and without exception they have all added value very quickly to the services we offer our customers,” he said. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of their experience, three of the Technician apprentices will have the chance during Apprenticeship Week to undertake a ‘job swap’ with Andy. He will shadow the trio through a series of experiments in the laboratory, then they will accompany him to a directors’ meeting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The growth in apprenticeships is driven not only by Costain’s requirements but by client demand. “A lot of our clients expect us to take on a certain number of apprentices per million pounds of spend,” explained Val. “This is all part of reducing the number of ‘NEETS’ – youngsters ‘not in education, employment or training’ as part of the drive to cut youth unemployment.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">3 February 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Karen Lewis, Health, Safety and Environment Administrator at the Costain Laing O’Rourke Joint Venture, Farringdon Station, is taking part in a ten day trek across Costa Rica to raise funds for the charity, Help For Heroes*.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costa Rica Jungle Trek, begins on February 15, and will take Karen across 350 kilometres/220 miles of the South American country, from the Pacific to the Caribbean coast.  The terrain is varied and involves jungle, tropical rainforest, cloud forest (high in the mountains), over Irazu, the highest volcano in Costa Rica, finally ending up on a tropical beach after six hours of white water rafting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Karen is one of 34 people attempting the challenge, and the team consists of Bryn and Emma Parry, the charity founders, and two injured soldiers, one of whom is blind and will be assisted by his brother.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In October 2010, Karen trekked 100km across the Sahara Desert and raised £9,000 for the charity.  This time Karen’s aim is to raise £12,000, which she has almost raised.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I need high fitness levels in order to compete and I have been on an intensive exercise regime and low fat diet,” said Karen. “This trek is rated much harder than the Sahara Desert.” </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Karen has paid for the trip out of her own funds which means that all sponsorship money will go straight to the charity and not used on expenses. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />*Help for Heroes was founded by Bryn and Emma Parry in October 2007 out of a desire to help the wounded service men and women returning from Afghanistan and Iraq. To date Help for Heroes has raised over £124 million.”<br /> </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">2 February 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has achieved a 100% pass rate with the first nine candidates from its Project Management Academy (PMA).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The candidates successfully completed the final interview stage of the Association of Project Management's (APM) assessment process to become Registered Project Professionals (RPP).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the process, participants had to show capability in 29 core competencies, including teamwork, planning, problem solving, leadership and communication, as well as demonstrate knowledge of 18 complementary competencies. Each of the candidates invested over 40 hours work in developing their portfolios, which are linked to the APM competence framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having successfully completed the portfolio assessment, candidates had to complete a 45 minute professional interview with two assessors. While the process is rigorous and extensive, becoming a RPP-designated project manager means a customer can be confident the individual has been externally assessed to the highest standard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The PMA is key to the ‘Choosing Costain’ strategy because it enhances the capability of the Group’s project management teams in delivering total solutions for its customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Launched in 2007, the PMA aims to raise the capability of project management across the Group and help its people gain a prestigious industry designation that recognises their ability to successfully manage a complex project. It is now hoped that more people from across the business will step up and sharpen their skills through the PMA and there is now no shortage of people who can pass on valuable experience on what it takes to succeed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It has provided me with a structure to all the knowledge and experience I have gained over my career and it will enable me to help and promote the RPP route for others,” said John Boyd, a Project Director, who has led the Costain drive for RPP.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Project Director, Geoff Hunt, who was also successful, said: “The questioning in the RPP was intense but I am delighted to have passed and I am keen to support others as a mentor and coach in the future.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the success of the candidates, Jeremy Galpin, Costain’s Training and Talent Manager, said: “Effective project management can be the most significant influence as to whether the project is a success or not. There is also an increasing demand from customers for evidence of our project management capability and, with its Project Management Academy, Costain is making great strides in meeting that demand.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The APM has produced an APM corporate accreditation case study of the Costain Project Management Academy that can be accessed <a href="http://www.apm.org.uk/sites/default/files/Images/Corporate%20Accreditation%20case%20study-Costain-low.pdf">here</a>.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>1 February 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is taking a leading role in helping charity CARE International UK hold a major fundraising event designed to improve housing and other basic facilities in the Third World.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The CARE Construction Challenge, to be held at Purbeck, Dorset, on 30 June, will see teams from Costain, its supply chain and other construction companies, take part in a marathon-length course (26 miles, 385 yards) split into sections completed on foot, bicycle and kayak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is one of the event’s main backers. Money to aid CARE International UK’s overseas efforts will be raised through sponsoring the teams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The charity operates in some of the poorest countries in the world. As well as providing disaster relief, it takes a long-term interest in communities, putting in place facilities such as clean water, health services and teacher-training that aim to help communities break the cycle of poverty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It also provides training in construction techniques for local people so they can build better homes for themselves and their community in future years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Our role in the Construction Challenge is to help the team at CARE International set the challenge up so it is of interest to the construction industry,” said Group Innovation Manager, Tim Embley. “We’ve been working with them over the past three years to shape the Challenge and to take it around the country to give the opportunity to Costain sites, our customers and supply chain across the UK to participate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“In the past the events have predominantly been held in Wales, last year it was in the Midlands and this year it will be on the South Coast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s a great opportunity for Costain site teams, clients and the supply chain to compete in friendly rivalry. Costain helps organise it as part of the ‘Costain Cares Commitment’, our corporate responsibility programme and as a major player in the industry we believe it’s important to play an active role in charitable work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“One of the key things this year is to encourage our sponsored students to play a role, whether they are at university or on work experience on Costain projects; hopefully we’ll see some young teams taking part alongside veterans!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Senior Planner, Phil Whitney, has competed in CARE events for the past three years, bringing several teams from Wales that together have raised more than £30,000 for the charity: “There’s a healthy rivalry between teams,” he said. “Last year we competed against different Costain projects, which gave us an opportunity to meet old friends and make new ones.”   </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Graduate Civil Engineer, Ros Parker, organised a team that competed last year for the first time.  “We had great fun raising the money and competing against other Costain teams and we’re looking forward to this year’s event,” she said. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on Costain’s commitment to the CARE Construction Challenge, Neil Munro, Head of CARE Challenge, said:  “Apart from raising vital funds for CARE, Costain employees have always been amongst the most enthusiastic and friendly participants.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To register your interest in this year’s event, contact CARE at this address: <a href="http://www.carechallenge.org.uk/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=1817&amp;Itemid=119">http://www.carechallenge.org.uk/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=1817&amp;Itemid=119</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The charity can offer practical help in setting up fundraising efforts.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>31 January 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Laing O’Rourke’s Joint Venture at Farringdon Station Project has donated over £6,125 to charity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the charities who have benefited from the 2011 fundraising are the Osteopathic Centre for Children, City of London Road Safety, Global Generation, St Bartholomew’s Hospital and Foyer Federation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The monies are raised whilst promoting ‘near miss reporting’, an integral part of any project.  When an operative reports a ‘near miss’, their name is entered into a draw to win a £50 gift voucher and £5 is also donated to charity.  The draw takes place during the regular SHE committee meetings and the winner then decides on the local charity for the next quarter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mick Franks, Project SHE Manager, commented: “The reporting of our near misses has given benefits to the site in preventing accidents by identifying trends from the near misses that have been raised.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jane Riddiford, Executive Director at Global Generation, commented: “A big thank you from Global Generation, your generous donation will go towards developing our new Skip Garden site in Kings Cross – where each year we involve children and young people in growing and selling local food.  They learn about themselves, the local community and the planet.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Farringdon Project is committed to being active in the local community by supporting local charities.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>30 January 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is pioneering the use of innovative computer software to help track documents in real time that will help speed up the sign-off process on large complex projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Called Zenator, the integrated completion management software is being used for the construction of a Wastewater Treatment Works and Sludge Recycling Centre at Peacehaven, Sussex, on behalf of Southern Water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the construction process, the amount of paperwork that is generated in order to get a project through to completion can be vast, yet is often overlooked.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, which is responsible for delivering the project with 4D Delivery partners MWH and Veolia Water, has over 50,000 documents which are all required to meet project completion requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project team are also aiming to get an exemplary turn of flow once the construction activities are completed but a key requirement for this to happen is the quick sign-off of handover documentation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Zenator software helps to manage dry-testing, wet-testing and commissioning documentation by generating reports on progress against expectation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The integrated completion management system uses bar codes which reduces the requirement of a document controller to manually file information. The system can be accessed by multiple users who can track the documentation through the design, construction and completion process. The system is also integrated with hand-held tablet devices like iPads but modified for the rigours of on-site use.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This integrated system helps us identify and close defects on a real time basis. The site inspectors can identify a defect on-site using a hand-held tablet device which is area coded, and then take immediate action to rectify any problem,” said Aalok Sonawala, Business Systems Manager on the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using handheld tablet technology isn’t new to Peacehaven. It was originally used at Costain Geotechnical Services, while the latest innovation was made possible through a knowledge sharing exercise with Costain’s Energy &amp; Process Division which had used similar Pathmaker software on that side of the business for some time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is a great example of utilising the most available technology and making the best use of it in order to meet client expectations. On every project, the completion of handover documentation and defect sign-off is critical for its successful delivery, and these new systems will further enable us to manage this process more efficiently,” Aalok said.<br /> </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">27 January 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has reached practical completion and handover of St George’s Hospital, in Lincoln, for the Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Trust two weeks ahead of schedule.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain was appointed on the Procure 21 framework contract as main contractor to demolish and redevelop the Yarborough Court area of the hospital, and to construct a new facility, Discovery House, on the same grounds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new building will act as a Rehabilitation Unit comprising separate male and female high dependency wards and a medium dependency mixed gender ward.  Work commenced on 18 October 2010 and was completed two weeks ahead of schedule on 28 November 2011. Handover was scheduled to take place on 12 December 2011. The design and build project had a total contract value of £11.5million and covered a gross internal floor area of 4000m2.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The locality of the hospital and the footprint of the building hindered both access to and manoeuvrability around the site and provided several challenges to the team. The team had to ensure the safety of existing patients and allow for deliveries to the hospital to continue as normal. The site was also bordered on three sides by local residents, which meant having to work very closely with the Trust to address any issues and concerns that the local residents had.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the project, Kevin Miners, the Project Manager, said: “We couldn’t have completed this project as successfully as we did without the help and cooperation of the client, Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Trust. If any issue arose, we worked very closely with the Trust to resolve those issues jointly, which included liaising with local residents, organising communal letter drops and organising public reference groups to offer guided tours of the site.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Len Hartley, Capital Projects Manager for Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Trust, said: “Costain and its team have demonstrated once again why it is one of the leading contractors in the industry.  Its approach to this project has been excellent from start to finish.  The care, consideration and attention to detail has been exceptional and the team has delivered a high quality building on budget, two weeks earlier than anticipated and in a safe and thoroughly professional manner.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ann Dodd, Clinical Lead for Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Trust, said: “The project has been a great success and everyone involved has demonstrated true partnership based on mutual respect. As a result, we have a beautiful building that has exceeded our expectations and will provide a modern, safe and therapeutic environment for patients to recover in.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">26 January 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is the first company in the UK to receive formal approval to use new concrete testing technology that is quicker, safer and more environmentally friendly to use than the traditional method of testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new lightweight single use cylinders are used to take concrete samples for strength testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Developed and tested in collaboration with Innovation Technologies, a company based in Surrey, Costain Environmental Services was given formal accreditation by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) after trialling the technology for nine months.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The United Kingdom Accreditation Service is the sole national accreditation body recognised by Government to assess, against internationally agreed standards, organisations that provide certification, testing, inspection and calibration services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While already widely used in the US and Europe, the lightweight cylinders are relatively new to the UK.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to their reduced size and weight, they are easier to carry and can be transported in bulk, which cuts carbon dioxide emissions by reducing the amount of trips needed to transport them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new technology is also better for the long-term health of employees. At the moment there are potential health and safety risks associated with the manual handling of the traditional heavy metal cubes but this is greatly reduced by replacing the metal moulds with lightweight plastic cylinders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Separately, the new technology also removes the need to use mould release oil which is a potential Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) risk.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting, Andy Bull, Environmental Services Director, said: “The new method addresses some key issues for both the customer and the technicians who have to test concrete. Our focus has been to reduce health and safety risk, improve productivity, help reduce a customer’s carbon footprint and at the same time making the solution quick and affordable to use.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">25 January 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is taking further measures towards improving its environmental performance with the launch of a campaign encouraging staff to choose ‘greener’ ways of getting to and from work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain Cares initiative takes account of the impact that the Company’s activities may have both locally and globally. With climate change generally agreed to be an effect of human activity, a responsible organisation such as Costain has to seek ways of reducing its impact on the environment by becoming more sustainable. This, in turn, plays a small part in helping the UK reach its challenging carbon reduction targets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having developed and launched its Climate Change Strategy in 2010, the Company set a long-term target to reduce its measured emissions by 35% by 2020, compared to its 2008 baseline.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Over the next 12 months a series of initiatives is being launched to enable employees to help Costain reach this ambitious target.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first of these involves Sustainable Transport. This is defined as a form of transport that has either no or low impact on the environment. With the Government having recently announced that transport emissions accounted for 25% of all UK emissions in 2010, it is an obvious area in which to try to be as economical as possible. For this reason Costain is encouraging staff and visitors to make more sustainable transport choices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initially, a travel options document has been added to the ‘Directions to Costain House’ sheet that is distributed to visitors to help them plan their journey.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For Maidenhead employees, a poster and information campaign is also being launched to inform staff of the benefits of sustainable transport both for themselves and the environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The poster has been produced for display on all notice boards in HQ. Additionally, a more detailed ‘Travel Guide’ document has been produced to provide staff with further information on the transport routes and options available to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain has business-wide targets and this will play a part in achieving that,” said Group Environmental Manager, Amy Shuffleton. “It’s a Maidenhead-based scheme but the idea is to extend it to other permanent offices and major sites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Over coming months in Maidenhead we will also be running an on-line travel survey to establish the current trends in methods of travelling to work, and to enable us to monitor and report on any changes.  It is also a great way for us to get feedback and any other ideas from staff.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">24 January 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rail travellers returning to Reading Station after the festive break discovered some of the first major tangible developments in an £80million refurbishment of the site being carried out by a Costain/Hochtief joint venture (CHJV).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The CHJV handed over a new Platform 4 to client Network Rail on 27 December, while a new temporary Platform 10 had taken shape in the middle of the existing running lines with tracks diverted around it. Platforms had also been renumbered.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Reading is one of the UK’s busiest stations outside London, handling around 17 million passengers annually. Not only is it on the Great Western Main Line for express services to South Wales and the West Country, it is the terminus for a network of local routes throughout Berkshire and Oxfordshire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The station’s renewal will take up to three years and involve a complete makeover. The number of platforms will increase from 10 to 15, the existing cramped footbridge over the tracks will be replaced by a much higher capacity ‘transfer deck’ and staircases from it down to the platforms will be replaced by escalators.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, new buildings will be constructed at the north and south entrances of the station, a new roof will be built across the site and virtually its entire infrastructure will be renewed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The overall effect will be hugely to improve the flow both of trains and passengers within the station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain/Hochtief team moved on-site in August last year and work had been proceeding 24 hours a day, seven days a week, since then, said Project Director, Brian Fisher.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“An enormous amount of work takes place at night,” he said. “There are no residential properties in the immediate area, although there are hotels and office blocks all around. Noise is not the biggest problem in the world but blocking roads [around the station] is a major issue.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The completion of Platform 4 on the southeast side of the station was the first of the five new platforms to be handed over. It will be used for local services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Platforms are relatively straightforward structures,” said Brian. “The concrete bits are easy – the difficulty comes in building them in the middle of a live railway, which is extremely complex.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new temporary platform 10, which will remain in situ for the next  18 months while the project is underway, was largely prefabricated off-site and lifted into position in sections from 24-27 December during a blockade, or closure, of the lines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It was a fairly major chunk of work,” said Brian.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain already has extensive experience in successfully remodelling major stations – notably St Pancras in central London – and has teamed up with Hochtief to offer a team with strong experience of this type of work for Network Rail. And, although not in the jv but being treated as a jv partner, Bailey Rail will be delivering the mechanical and electrical works on the contract.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Director of Rail, Gren Edwards, commented: “The multidisciplinary capabilities offered by our team at Reading have the necessary breadth and depth to deliver this demanding programme of works and we are delighted to be working closely with client Network Rail and the rest of the Reading Station supply chain.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The station renewal is just part of a huge £850million exercise to completely revamp the rail system in the Reading area that will include renewal of track, signalling and bridges.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Network Rail aims to ‘decongest’ the area by adding track capacity that will not only eliminate the current problem of trains having to wait outside Reading Station for a platform to become available, but allow for six extra freight trains a day to use lines in the area, taking up to 200 trucks off local roads.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other major facets will include construction of a new viaduct west of Reading to carry fast mainline services over freight and relief lines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And although the larger project outside the immediate station area will take around six years to complete, passengers at Reading will feel the benefits of the station renewal as soon as it is finished, said Gren.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">20 January 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction industry professionals and ICE members gathered in London recently to discuss the business case for improved health and safety in the workplace at the ICE &amp; Costain 2011 Health &amp; Safety Lecture.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hosted by Costain’s Environment Managing Director, Alan Kay, speakers from Government, regulation and employers discussed whether investment in occupational health brought universal benefits to individuals, businesses and the taxpayer, and whether health and safety actually improved operational performance by reducing the propensity for accidents to happen on site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Speakers included Dame Carol Black, Professor of Rheumatology at UCL and the first National Director for Health and Work whose Department of Works and Pensions review “Working for a Healthier Tomorrow” found that ill health amongst the working population costs the UK £100billion a year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also speaking was Philip White, the HSE’s Chief Inspector of Construction and formerly an advisor at the DWP, and Lawrence Waterman, the Head of Health &amp; Safety at the Olympic Delivery Authority, who was previously Occupational Health Advisor to Heathrow Terminal 5, and a founder-member of Sypol, a risk management services company specialising in health and safety.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the event, Alan Kay said: “I would like to thank the speakers and everyone who attended the lecture for making it a success. The health and general wellbeing of a workforce is at the forefront of what we do as a business and fostering a safe working environment is imperative for protecting all stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers and the general public.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">18 January 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is the first company in the UK to receive independent third party accreditation for its Behavioural Safety Programme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Cambridge Centre for Behavioural Studies (CCBS), an independent non-profit organisation based in Massachusetts in the United States, formally accredited Costain in December for the performance of its safety programme, Costain Behavioural Safety (CBS).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CCBS pioneers the scientific study of behaviour in order to provide solutions to practical problems in the workplace and community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A team from CCBS travelled to the UK in November 2011 for a five-day visit and to undertake a rigorous audit of Costain’s Behavioural Safety Programme. The team visited Costain’s offices in Maidenhead and Manchester as well as projects at Brighton &amp; Hove, Bond Street, Bidston Moss and Five Fords. The team interviewed employees and managers to hear how the Company has increasingly used and implemented the CBS programme to help improve the standard of health and safety across the Group.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dr Philip Chase, the CCBS Executive Director, said: “We were impressed with Costain’s level of commitment and success in creating safe environments for its workforce and clients. Costain has created a process in which leadership is the focus; it has spent considerable time decoding behavioural science and behaviour-based safety so that company leaders can apply the concepts in ways that work to make the Company better.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CBS forms an integral part of the Group’s overall safety, health, and environment programme through Costain Cares, which aims to address the growing needs of its stakeholders, including its employees, through greater corporate responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Devised in 2005, CBS was first piloted on the United Utilities and 4D Frameworks. Courses were designed to teach behaviour management and leadership-led safety which helped to achieve the equivalent of 7 million man-hours of injury-free work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CBS has now been developed to incorporate all projects and joint ventures. A CBS Delivery Manager works with each project team to develop a project specific training plan and implementation plan to address the specific needs and requirements of each project at any point in time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The programme initially focuses on the behaviours of our Directors and senior leaders within the business, as it’s their behaviour that creates the environment which ultimately determines the success and performance of the business,” said Alan Cheung, CBS Delivery Manager.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alan Kay, Managing Director of the Environment Division, said: “We are delighted to have received third-party recognition for our CBS Program which has increased overall participation and responsibility in all aspects of health and safety, not just across the Group but also with our joint venture partners as well.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting, Peter Fisher, Costain’s Health and Safety Director, added: “A good health and safety record is central to the success of our business and that means having not only the right procedures and processes in place but also the right culture to underpin them. We have helped to achieve this by using a behavioural based approach like CBS which helps people change the environment they work in."</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">17 January 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has completed the refurbishment of an old water tower at Alanbrooke Barracks for the Ministry of Defence which will extend the life of the asset by at least 30 years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Situated near Thirsk on the edge of the Yorkshire Dales and supplying water to the barracks, the tower was constructed in the 1940s and can hold up to 227 cubic meters of potable water. Over time the tower’s condition had deteriorated, with the external concrete showing signs of spalling, or erosion, which had exposed the reinforcing bars. There was damage to all faces of the tower, but more so to corners and around the openings to windows.  Attempts had been made over the years to patch repair the tower but new areas of spalling had occurred and a more permanent and sustainable solution was required to make the tower safe and extend the life for the asset.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under a C2C Design and Build Framework, Costain was commissioned to carry-out a feasibility study which highlighted several options, ranging from simply re-patching the spalling areas to demolishing the asset and constructing a new tower. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Potential solutions were reviewed by the customer, C2C Services Project Engineer, Ian Smith, and the framework team, based on the expenditure, the enhancement to the asset condition and the extension of the asset life and a refurbishment of the structure was considered the most suitable option.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The refurbishment work comprised the removal of spalling and mechanical cleaning. The defective area was repaired using a specialist repair mortar and, followed by a further cleaning of the tower’s surfaces, applying a migration corrosion inhibitor (MCI) to provide further protection to the tower’s surfaces and give additional strength to the existing reinforcement bars.  Lastly, a fairing coat was applied as a final finish to the external surfaces. Access to the surfaces of the tower was made via an all enclosed access scaffold installed by supply chain partners HARSCO.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the project, Warren Lee, the C2C Design and Build Framework Manager, said: “The project has been a success in terms of safety and client satisfaction. It was undertaken during one of the bleakest winters on record. Wrapping a 60m high tower with access scaffolding and protective sheeting enabled the concrete repairs to be undertaken in all weathers. The site team and supply chain worked tirelessly to ensure the project was completed in a safe manner and on programme. During the construction phase, the tower experienced gales in excess of 80mph with the access scaffold remaining structurally sound throughout.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">17 January 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Client satisfaction with Costain Environmental Services (formerly GSD) is reaching new heights as the division seeks feedback from its customer base.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Quarterly client surveys that began in late 2008 have shown a steady overall improvement in ratings for Environmental Services' performance. Since 2009, average scores have improved considerably. In terms of highest scores achieved for particular aspects of work, figures have jumped from 75% in 2008 to a remarkable 98% in 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to recognise that the increase in scores has been achieved over a considerably larger customer base. When the process started, there was a 40% response rate from 34 clients. Today, the response rate has risen to 65% among 82 clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We use the same questionnaire that’s used by Costain to rate its supply chain,” explained Performance Manager, Carly White. “Effectively we reverse the questionnaire by asking clients to rate us.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Customers mark us under five headings – People, Time, Cost, Quality and Safety. “We’ve always been rated pretty well on safety,” added Carly. “We’ve improved mainly in areas such as communication, collaboration, teamwork and adequacy of supervision”.”When we first started the process, it was designed to find out where we were. Problems were identified. We looked through the results to see where improvements could be made in the business and then put the necessary fixes in place.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The system was very responsive to problems that raised their heads and any proposed solution was closely monitored to ensure it worked, she said. “Clients have proved quite receptive to this. It’s definitely helped to build relationships.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Environmental Services work is conducted for a mix of both external customers and internal clients elsewhere within Costain. Interestingly, said Carly, most of the complimentary responses came from external sources: “Perhaps Costain clients have particularly high standards that reflect the Group values,” she ventured.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">12 January 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two heroic AOne+ employees have been praised by Northampton Police and the Highways Agency for rescuing a driver trapped inside a burning car on the A45.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Richie Stripp and Tony Austin work for AONE+, a joint venture between Costain, Colas and Halcrow, which maintains motorways and major trunk roads in the East Midlands on behalf of the Highways Agency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Richie and Tony were returning from a repair job when they came across the accident near Wootton Junction, in Northamptonshire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“There were several members of the public already on the scene and clearly panicking about what to do. When we arrived in our maintenance vehicle and high-viz clothing, all eyes turned to us for assistance,” said Richie.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before they knew what was happening the car set on fire with the dazed driver still trapped inside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Neither of us gave it a second thought; we just knew instinctively that we had to get the driver out and move the onlookers away from the incident in case the vehicle exploded,” Richie said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tony added: “Once we had got the driver safely out of the car, we also closed the slip road using the cones on our vehicle to stop other motorists coming to harm and also to allow the emergency services to get immediate access to the scene once they arrived.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The driver of the vehicle, who wishes to remain anonymous, has expressed his sincere gratitude to Richie and Tony.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting, Superintendent Sean Bell, from Northamptonshire Police, said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Immediately and without regard for their own safety, the crew went to the burning car and between them got the driver out, consciously asking what injuries he had sustained.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The driver was having a medical episode and was unable to help himself. When he finally came round he had no recollection of what had happened and where he was.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Not only did they rescue the driver but they also managed to keep the public back and close the slip road prior to us arriving with the fire service, thus keeping others safe as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“If Richie and Tony had of not acted in such a fashion, it may have become a fatality.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Martin Fellows, East Midlands Regional Director of the Highways Agency, added:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Richie and Tony showed exceptional courage and we highly commend their actions which not only saved the motorists life, but also prevented others from coming to harm.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">12 January 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain celebrated the successful completion of a strategically important project recently with the handover of the gas processing plant for the Holford underground gas storage facility, in Cheshire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The facility, which belongs to E.ON, will play a vital role in the future of UK's energy infrastructure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first three caverns, which represent the first phase of the development, are now commercially available with a capacity of 60 million cubic metres. When all eight caverns are in operation at the end of 2012, Holford will have a capacity of up to 160 million cubic metres.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project was delivered in an integrated team combining the knowledge, experience and expertise of E.ON, Costain and supply chain partners from across UK and Europe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s scope included the engineering, procurement and construction management for the gas processing plant and associated infrastructure, including modification works to the wellheads to allow the caverns to be prepared for gas trading.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project has received industry-wide recognition, being Highly Commended in the Chemical Engineering Project of the Year category at the IChemE Awards for Innovation and Excellence in November 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the start of operations at Holford, Mike Cooper, E.ON’s Project Manager said: “This is a major achievement for the project team who have successfully addressed a number of complex technical and engineering challenges in delivering the operational facility at Holford. We would like to thank the Costain team for its effort and commitment in achieving this important handover milestone.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Charles Sweeney, Managing Director of Costain’s Energy &amp; Process division added: “The ability to store large amounts of gas to help ensure security of supply is vital for the UK’s future energy mix. This facility will increase the country’s storage capacity and is an example of Costain’s commitment to meeting national needs.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Water Customer  Director has been invited to take a role in helping oversee an important document that could influence the future shape of Government policy towards the industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Matt Crabtree will sit on an Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) Lifed Panel supervising the delivery of a review of the sector as part of the ICE’s ‘State of the Nation’ series of papers.  The document is due to be delivered in June 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In asking him to take part, Andrew Crudginton, the ICE’s Head of Policy, commented that the Institution was "keen to ensure a balance of perspectives on the Group and felt that Costain’s extensive contracting experience in the sector would bring a lot to the project."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Matt’s commitment will involve attending steering group meetings plus evidentiary hearings, when Group members have a chance to interrogate experts from across the Sector. He will also review drafts of the report at various stages of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group will be responsible for steering the direction of the project and assuring the quality of the outputs. “We’ll have an overview of the document and also have a ‘project management’ role to ensure that it is produced in time,” he added.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“These documents go into the public domain and the aspiration is that they go to Government and influencers.” As a respected professional body, it can be expected that the report will carry some weight with ministers and officials.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The invitation to Matt to take part is a further indicator of Costain’s reputation in the water sector.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">10 January 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Customers are becoming more ‘intelligent’ in how they procure products and services from suppliers and contractors, and construction companies need to adapt and become more intelligent themselves to succeed in the current economic and commercial environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That was the message from Costain’s Adam Bennett, a Project Systems and Performance Manager on the M53 Bidston Moss Viaduct refurbishment scheme, and Katie Swanick, a civil engineer on Bidston Moss, who took part in a roundtable discussion, called Leaders For Tomorrow, on the future of the construction industry and how companies can provide an optimal level of service to their customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The debate was hosted at law firm Pinsent Masons in the City of London and was attended by major blue-chip service providers and a wide range of representatives from the construction industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The discussion focused around three questions: what makes an intelligent customer; what makes an intelligent supplier; and what are the essential features of a more modern commercial and contractual relationship?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An 'intelligent customer' has the financial, commercial, technical and operational capabilities to plan, procure, develop and manage infrastructure assets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Citing the Highways Agency as an example of an intelligent customer and using the Bidston Moss Viaduct, the Avonmouth Viaduct and the Tinsley Viaduct as case studies, Adam gave a presentation on how the Agency has gradually evolved its procurement practice in order to maximise the use of its resources more effectively.  His presentation demonstrated how the Agency has learnt to become more successful in achieving expected outrun costs in delivering complex infrastructure projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In line with this, Costain has increasingly employed Value Engineering, which involves applying innovative tailor made solutions to project specific problems. The aim is to deliver the same or better product while using few resources, which can save time and money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The M53 Bidston Moss strengthening project is a perfect example of how to procure a complex project, involving early contractor involvement, a fully integrated supply chain and providing an environment for innovation.  This has allowed the project to be delivering key milestones ahead of programme and under budget whilst exceeding all customer and stakeholder expectations, and more importantly, reduced disruption to the travelling public,” said Adam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Outcomes from the roundtable discussion will be presented in a paper, with Constructing Excellence, highlighting the value of infrastructure and its importance for the future prosperity of the UK.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Graham Robinson, Global Business Consultant at Pinsent Masons, said: “Adam’s presentation highlighted in a practical way the benefit of a more modern and intelligent approach to construction and how this has evolved carefully over a number of projects. Costain is to be congratulated on its innovative approach.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Graham Robinson presented to the group the findings from Infrastructure in the New Era, a report published by Pinsent Masons and Constructing Excellence, where the concept of the intelligent customer and intelligent supplier were outlined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shy Jackson, a Senior Associate at Pinsent Masons, added: “What was interesting is that Costain could demonstrate the importance of an intelligent customer in procuring infrastructure of national importance.  The UK competes on a global stage to attract investment and our infrastructure is part of our future prosperity that attracts wealth generation.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">9 January 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has signalled its recognition of the growing importance of Building Information Modelling (BIM) in the construction industry with the appointment of a Group BIM Manager.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Matt Blackwell takes up the role of overseeing the system within the Company. BIM allows planners, designers and the construction team to progressively add information about a project as it progresses to an electronic database.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the time of handover, the body of knowledge that has been built up effectively amounts to an asset manual. It details the structure and informs the new owner or operator about its life cycle management, including plant, resource and materials required to undertake a particular repair or piece of maintenance, for example, and the equipment needed to effect that repair. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BIM is becoming increasingly prevalent in the construction industry, after having been used in the hydrocarbons, automotive and aerospace sectors for many years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s a ‘must have’ for a number of reasons,” says Costain’s Technical Director, Bill Hewlett. “The most obvious reason is that the Government is mandating Level 2 BIM as a minimum compliance standard by 2016 for all its suppliers. That’s the ‘stick’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The ‘carrot’ is that industry has reached a tipping point where the benefits are being appreciated by clients. They appreciate that the job will work better in terms of its delivery, but also because they end up with a proper asset record that they can then use for asset management through its life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“There is a whole set of benefits. The benefit to us is that we’re delivering a better service to customers. It allows us to plan the job better, so it can be safer and allows us to deliver a better job.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Matt agrees that “There are numerous benefits, although these depend on the individual project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Different people have different perceptions and have different definitions of BIM. Some people think that if you just do a 3D model of a building and link it to the construction programme, it’s BIM - but it's not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The definition we’ve been giving to our supply chain and customers is that it’s a 3D model linked to a database of information that allows you to provide the right information to the right people at the right time and in the right format. This ensures a higher quality product delivered safely, to time and budget. It reduces re-work because people are sufficiently well-informed that they don’t have to go back and re-do something.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“As part of the process we capture evidence throughout, and advise our customers on the benefits of applying BIM. We use this in our bids and prequalifictions so we provide information that we’ve done this type of work before and demonstrate the value we can add to the customer."</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">5 January 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, one of the UK's leading engineering solutions providers, will announce preliminary results for the year ended 31 December 2011 on Wednesday 7 March 2012, and is issuing a trading update ahead of entering its Close Period.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Trading update</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the announcement of the Group's Interim Management Statement on 7 November 2011, Costain continues to perform well and consequently finished the year in line with the Board's expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a result of its strategy of focussing on major public and private sector customers whose spending plans are driven by national need, regulatory commitments or essential maintenance requirements, Costain secured significant new contracts during the year, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>London Bridge Station redevelopment for Network Rail;</li>
<li>Crossrail Paddington Station and advanced works at Crossrail Bond Street;</li>
<li>A465 Heads of the Valleys road for the Welsh Government;</li>
<li>Contracts for Northumbrian Water AMP5 and Severn Trent;</li>
<li>Energy Technologies Institute (ETI) development of carbon capture technology;</li>
<li>Decommissioning contract at Trawsfynydd nuclear site.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group finished the year with an increased forward Order Book of £2.5 billion (2010: £2.4 billion), which included in excess of £650 million of work secured for 2012 and over £1.8 billion of revenue secured for 2013 and beyond.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, Costain has a strong preferred bidder position at circa £400 million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group made two acquisitions during the year. ClerkMaxwell, the front end engineering support services provider acquired in April, and Promanex, the industrial support services business acquired in August, both of which are performing well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Financial position</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There has been no material change in the financial position of the Group, which has a strong cash position of in excess of £100 million and no significant borrowings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently, the Group has further enhanced and extended its contract bonding and banking facilities with its relationship banks and surety companies. The facilities were increased by £30 million to £465 million and extended by two years to September 2015. These facilities ensure the Group has the necessary financial resources to capitalise on market opportunities as they arise and achieve its medium term objectives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive, commented:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>“We have continued to benefit throughout this year from the implementation of our ‘Choosing Costain’ strategy, which has been to focus on blue chip customers in chosen sectors whose major spending plans are underpinned by strategic national needs, regulatory commitments or essential maintenance requirements.”</em></strong></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">4 January 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, in conjunction with 4D and Southern Water, recently helped to raise £11,500 for Macmillan Cancer Support at Southern Water’s Irish Saturday Charity Race Day at Fontwell Park Racecourse, in West Sussex.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The day comprised seven races, with Costain sponsoring one race – The 4D Race – along with its 4D partners MWH and Veolia Water. Now in its fifth year, the event attracted 6,000 people and raised £80,000 in total for charities chosen by Southern Water staff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, which is working with Southern Water on the 4Delivery project to deliver a programme of capital works including a major new wastewater plant to serve Brighton and Hove, took a table at the three-course lunch hosted by Alan Kay, Costain Managing Director - Environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tables were also taken by 4D and the Brighton &amp; Hove team and money was raised through table sales, auctions and raffles in the hospitality lounge. Entertainment was provided by Irish rockers The Saw Doctors at an open air concert.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s chosen charity was Macmillan Cancer Support which provides practical, medical, emotional and financial support for people whose lives have been affected by cancer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The official presentation of the cheque took place on 23 November with the money going towards the Sussex Macmillan Cancer Information and Support Centre in Brighton where Macmillan has a £3.7million appeal. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new centre will help people living with cancer across the Sussex cancer network and will offer specialist information and quality resources, welfare benefits advice, counselling services, complementary therapies, a hair and wig service, a café and dietary advice, as well as self help and support groups.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mandy Kendall, Fundraising Manager at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: “We want to say a very big thank you to Costain, 4D and Southern Water for their support and for putting on a fantastic day. Without the support of companies like Costain and Southern Water we wouldn’t be able to reach our aim of ensuring that every person affected by cancer receives the support, information and care that they need.” </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the event, Graham Keegan, Costain's Water Director, said: “We are proud to have been associated with Macmillan Cancer Support and thank Southern Water for putting on a spectacular day which was enjoyed by all.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">3 January 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain Laing O’Rourke JV Project team has successfully completed the latest major milestone delivery at the £250million Farringdon Station redevelopment: the handover of the lengthened platforms that enable train operator First Capital Connect to operate 12-car trains through the station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a key step on the road to creating a major capacity expansion on the Thameslink route, which runs from Bedford, in the north, to Brighton, in the south.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The lengthened platforms were handed over to client Network Rail recently, with First Capital Connect starting its expanded service two days later.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having completed the 12-car platforms, the team now has to maintain focus and deliver the next phase of the station. February 6 2012 will see the team finishing the internal changes to the existing 1920s London Underground (LU) station building and completion of the station accommodation building.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the new platforms the Farringdon redevelopment has included a new train shed roof, construction of a new LU entrance structure, a new Integrated Ticket Hall (ITH), replacement of the highway bridge to the front of the station, the installation of new power supplies and plant rooms, three new escape staircases; and installation of five new lifts to allow step-free access from platforms to street level. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The platform extensions have been accomplished in four-hour overnight possessions after train services shut down, supplemented with weekend possessions. This has made logistics – ensuring that materials are at the right place at the right time in order to take advantage of the small working windows – one of the project’s biggest challenges.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also opened recently was the new ITH, becoming the new entrance and focus for all national rail services including ticket sales, directly across the road from the existing LU station entrance. This new facility will also become the access to the new Crossrail service when that comes into operation later this decade. Completion of the ITH allowed the closure of the current London Underground building on Cowcross Street.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The JV team has been allocated an eight-week closure of the LU building and concourse, which includes two major NR possessions, of 101 hours over Christmas and 24 hours over the new year period, to maximise the opportunity for a sustained period of working on this remaining section of the station and to minimise the impact to the travelling public.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Farringdon’s historic status as the terminus of the world’s first underground railway, the Metropolitan Line, means that all aspects of the work on the LUL building require the approval of English Heritage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s now another drive to complete the next milestone,” said Construction Director, Daniel Powrie. “The Farringdon team has worked tirelessly for three years to deliver the 12-car platforms and the ITH and now we have to hand over the LU building and accommodation building in eight weeks – no simple task given the high specification and number of trades required to work in a very confined conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Fortunately, we have a brilliant team at Farringdon and we have yet to miss a single milestone, so we are confident we will deliver this one, too.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">3 January 2012</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s joint venture with Laing O’Rourke to develop London Underground’s Bond Street station, in central London, has been showcased as an example of how to use mobile technology to get information to front line construction industry staff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Engineer, Beth Willoughby, gave a presentation to the annual COMIT (Construction Opportunities for Mobile IT) conference on how new technology could improve the flow of knowledge to a project site – and challenged her audience to make it happen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">COMIT is an organisation made up of construction and IT bodies whose role is to promote mobile technology in construction.  Costain is a founding member. The conference was held at University College London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’ve worked for over seven years to promote mobile technology and its use in the construction industry,” said Group Innovation and Knowledge Manager, Tim Embley. “This year, Costain played a major role in structuring the agenda in line with our business strategy, which is all about improving service to our customers.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One way of doing so was via mobile technology, which could reduce costs, improve quality and enhance safe project delivery, he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beth’s talk to the COMIT audience outlined how Building Information Modelling (BIM), which seeks to maintain a flow of information through a project’s lifespan, from design through construction to maintenance of a completed asset, is being implemented at Bond Street.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Beth’s challenge was about getting the information to the site team using iPads and being able to access information right at the coal face,” said Tim.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“In the past BIM has been a designer’s tool,” added Costain’s Systems and Technology Director, Bill Price. “This is taking it down to the front line. She produced what was almost a working mock-up to demonstrate to people what she wanted and challenged the industry to deliver that.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her presentation was effectively ‘A morning in the life of a site manager’ showing how an iPad could be used to deliver start-of-work briefings, with videos of the worksite and indications of vital information such as safe areas, said Bill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beth added: "This is what I want to see; now it’s up to the mobile technology industry to collaborate with Costain and develop the tools to make it happen.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ends</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">23 December 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sub Contractors on one of Costain’s water frameworks are benefiting from occupational health checks in new medical facilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Finham Sewage Treatment Works, on the Severn Trent Framework in Warwickshire, is the venue for the Supply Chain to receive safety critical worker medical assessments.  This enables the supply chain to comply with the Group’s safety critical medical policy for safety critical trades, such as those working in confined spaces, at height without collective fall protection and high speed road workers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The assessments are facilitated by Occupational Health Consultants, K2 Associates, and, since the beginning of November 2011, 50 Supply Chain subcontractors have received safety critical worker medicals.  Towards the end of the AMP5 framework 500 - 1000 people are expected to receive a medical assessment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company, K2 Associates, was selected to carry out the checks as it had a proven track record working on the M1 Junction 10-13 Improvements Scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Simon Cox, Framework SHE Manager, on the Severn Trent Water scheme, said: “The Block Schemes Delivery team has done an excellent job of facilitating the Safety Critical Assessments for our supply chain with superb medical facilities at our Finham offices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“A number of occupational health issues have been picked up during these assessments with people being referred back to their own GPs with issues such as high blood pressure, high Body Mass Index and occupational dermatitis. Any process which raises the awareness of occupational health and wellbeing in the construction industry can only have a positive outcome.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The safety critical worker health screening is a further example of how the <a href="/responsibility/costain-cares.aspx">Costain Cares </a>initiative is being implemented within the Group.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>21 December 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of Costain’s Civil Engineers, Mark Billyard, is rising to ‘the Gold Challenge’. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In partnership with the British Olympic Association, the Gold Challenge is the charity challenge where participants take on Olympic Sports and Paralympic Sports to raise money.  Participants choose from a variety of challenges available and fundraise money for one of Gold Challenge’s 125 charities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mark is raising money for Cancer Research UK.   He has achieved good results in 17 events during 2011, including the Hampton Court Swim, three middle distance triathlons, his first marathon which he completed in 3 hrs 57 mins and three half marathons, the fastest of which he completed in 1 hr 33 mins. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mark will continue with the challenge during 2012.  In particular, he will be focusing on Ironman Lanzarote, a lung-bursting 3,800m swim, 180km bike ride and a 42km run which he is aiming to complete in 10.5 – 11 hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mark said: “The last year has involved a huge amount of effort, but it’s also been tremendously rewarding. I’ve completed all of the events in my own time, fitting training and competing around work commitments. So far I’ve had a good response from friends, family and colleagues, but any contribution helps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s all helping a great cause and one that I care a lot about in Cancer Research UK. Cancer is something that many others are affected by personally at some point in their lives, whether it’s themselves, a family member or a close friend. The more support I can get the better, particularly as I build towards my first ironman and beyond in 2012, generating as much money as I can for a great cause!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you would like to sponsor Mark and help raise money for Cancer Research UK, please see his just giving page on the attached link.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">13 December 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of Costain’s longest-serving employees has left his last building site after a 44-year career with the Company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dave Phillips retired as a Package Manager on the Newbury Parkway shopping centre project after a working life that saw him criss-cross the whole of the UK over a long series of contracts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He began life with Costain as a labourer in 1967, working on a Basingstoke office block. Over the years he steadily worked his way through the ranks, from ganger to foreman, general foreman, section manager and senior site manager.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He rates his final job, Newbury, as perhaps the most challenging of his career, due to a combination of its town centre location, deep excavations and the major dewatering exercise that was required to cope with the locality’s high water table.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His first 17 years were spent working around the London area, but it is some of his jobs further afield – many of them spent creating parts of the UK’s infrastructure such as Parc prison near Bridgend in South Wales, Reading University, the Met Office in Exeter and several schools in South Wales in the 1990s that most readily come to mind when he is recalling details of his career.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest change he has observed over more than four decades has been Costain’s move away from being a traditional construction company employing its own labourers and trades to its present incarnation as a management contractor expanding rapidly into utilities such as water, nuclear, waste and rail, he says.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given the establishment’s reputation among the general public, it may come as a surprise that he rates a sequence of three contracts at Broadmoor, the secure hospital for the criminally insane, as possibly the job he enjoyed most: “I was a keyholder, I had freedom of movement and I got to know many of the staff when I was there. The Defence Academy of the United Kingdom at Shrivenham, Oxfordshire, was another good job, that we finished ahead programme. To be honest, there were no really bad jobs.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That, he says, was at least partly down to the teams with which he worked: “I can’t honestly say I ever worked with a bad bunch. I’ve always managed to get on with people and that really helps; it makes life a lot easier.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The only bad aspect of some jobs, he says, was the amount of travelling involved. Latterly, he bought a bungalow for his retirement in Rhoose, near Cardiff Airport, in the Vale of Glamorgan overlooking the Bristol Channel and moved down to South Wales more than three years ago. As his final job was at Newbury in Berkshire, that entailed a regular 4am Monday start, “Which I certainly don’t miss.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among the people who will regret Phillips’ departure, says Warren McPhee, General Foreman on his last job at Newbury, will be young managers, many of whose careers the veteran helped to progress: “Dave was a true gent, who’ll be sorely missed.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">13 December 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, as part of A-One+, a joint venture with Halcrow and Colas, recently scooped a top award at the Highways Magazine Excellence Awards 2011, in London, for its work in developing innovative technology that improves the safety of road maintenance contractors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team won the Highway Worker and Site Safety Initiative Award for helping, in association with Highway Resource Solutions, to develop the Intellicone work zone perimeter alarm, an integrated safety solution that transforms ordinary temporary road barriers like traffic cones into an electronic safety perimeter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Trialled by the A-one+ Errant Vehicles Working Group, the patented Intellicone Technology is based on a wireless sensor network that enables automatic detection of a cone barrier breach which automatically activates an audio-visual site alarm system. The alarm gives roadside workers an instant warning that a work zone perimeter has been breached and allows workers to take evasive action.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The awards at the Royal Garden Hotel in London on October 12 recognise and celebrate excellence and innovation within the highways sector. The awards are in association with and judged by the Highways Agency and the Department for Transport. The team also received the special merit award as a “Winner of Winners” for the same product.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the award to A-One+, the judges said: "Intellicone is a good example of the use of technology to aid safety through increasing warning to road workers.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peter Fisher, Costain’s Group SHE Director, said: “Costain and the A-One+ team are delighted to have won this award which demonstrates how teamwork and utilising best practice can lead to developing innovative solutions in the work environment.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">8 December 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain and Laing O’Rourke, a joint venture working on the redevelopment of Farringdon Station in central London, has won a prestigious Gold Green Apple Environment Award for its sustainable approach to building and construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Green Apple Awards recognise environmental best practice and the business reasons behind employing environmental initiatives in order to safeguard the environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project won by demonstrating how sustainable development can have both an environmental and economic benefit. For example, the team diverted 100% of the demolition waste from landfill which saved £365,000 in landfill tax, while reusing the rubble from the demolition removed the need for approximately 850 lorry movements which saved 30 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions and approximately £70,000 on the cost of additional materials. For the new ticket hall, instead of using what would have amounted to 500 tons of steel, the team used an eco-reinforced alternative that was 95% recycled and responsibly sourced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project – a £189million contract which includes lengthening the platforms, refurbishing the existing listed station building and building a new entrance and integrated ticket hall, is now preparing for 12-car Thameslink trains to arrive on 12 December 2011. From 2018, Farringdon will become London’s newest transport hub and the only interchange between the north/south Thameslink and the east/west Crossrail route.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The initiatives at Farringdon illustrate the successful implementation of Costain’s long-term operational strategy, Costain Cares, which aims to promote a more sustainable business by addressing the growing needs of its stakeholders. Costain is trying to reduce the environmental impact of its work by minimising the amount of material it uses and waste it produces.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Daniel Powrie, Construction Director at Farringdon, said: “Being green is no longer an expensive add-on. This award demonstrates the commercial benefits which can easily be built into construction projects. We are proud of our Environmental credentials at Farringdon and hope the lessons learnt here will be utilised throughout Costain.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">6 December 2011</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Costain’s strong reputation as a supplier of choice in the highways sector was recognised at a major highways awards ceremony last week with the Company, along with its joint venture partners, winning four out of the five categories at the Highways Agency Supplier Recognition ceremony.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This is the first year of the Highways Agency’s new supplier recognition scheme, which highlighted the important contribution made by the Agency’s suppliers in supporting the operation, maintenance and improvement of the strategic road network in England. The awards also acknowledged the efforts of suppliers who had shown a leading performance and delivered the highest level of customer service.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Suppliers including joint ventures, lower tiers, small and medium sized enterprises from all aspects of the Highways Agency business, were invited to be recognised in five key business areas, which formed the five categories for the awards.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In total, there were 80 award entries from 27 different suppliers. As a company that is responsible for maintaining one in every three miles of the nation’s strategic roads on behalf of the Highways Agency, Costain was recognised in its own right, as well as with Carillion, its M1 Junction 10-13 joint venture partner, and AOne+, a joint venture between Costain, Colas and Halcrow, for the following awards:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">-         <strong>Managing down cost/improving value:</strong> Awarded to suppliers that demonstrated significant achievement in mobilising all their talents and resources to deliver smarter and more efficient ways of working in delivering Highways Agency contracts. <strong>Awarded to:</strong>  AOne+, for providing cost savings across four MAC contracts covering about a third of the strategic network;</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">-         <strong>Supply Chain Management:</strong>  Awarded to suppliers that had embedded the Highways Agency’s strategic agenda, values and principles through their supply chains. <strong>Awarded to:</strong> Costain for supply chain integration in the delivery of the M53 Bidston Moss scheme.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">-         <strong>Health and Safety:</strong> Awarded to suppliers that showed industry leading commitment to improving corporate and workforce health and safety. <strong>Awarded to:</strong>  Costain Carillion JV, for employee occupational health and welfare on the M1 Junction 10 to 13 contract; and to Costain for the health and safety practices put in place in delivery of the M53 Bidston Moss scheme, which achieved zero RIDDOR-reportable incidents in the last 1.1m worked hours.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">-         <strong>Building &amp; Sustaining Capability:</strong> Awarded to suppliers that have created opportunities to bring people into the workplace and develop skills and capabilities through delivery of Highways Agency contracts. <strong>Awarded to:</strong>  AOne+, for creating opportunities to enter the workplace and developing employees’ skills and capabilities through the delivery of four MAC contracts.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Graham Dalton, Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, said:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">“Our vision is to build on our already world-class reputation, to be recognised as the world’s leading road operator; that means working in close partnership with our suppliers to meet the diverse needs of our customers – road users and the communities we serve.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">“Both the number and quality of the entries we received for these awards demonstrate the importance which our suppliers place on the performance they deliver – and by recognising their industry-leading performance, and encouraging our supply family to share best practice, we are showing that we’re proud to acknowledge their dedication and innovation on our behalf.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Commenting on the awards, Tim Bowen, Costain Highways Director, said: “We are delighted to have been recognised, along with our joint venture partners, by the Highways Agency in their Supplier Recognition Awards which emphasises our ongoing commitment to the Agency and to the highways sector, and our expertise in delivering innovative solutions to our customers.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">5 December 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has picked up number one accolade in the Civil Engineering category of this year’s Concrete Society Awards for its work at the Riverside Resource Recovery Facility at Belvedere, London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company was the civils, building facilities and marine works design-and-build contractor on the huge waste management facility, which is one of the largest energy-from-waste plants in Europe and is currently being put through its operational tests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It will generate electricity to power 66,000 homes, keeping 100,000 HGVs off the roads by shipping waste to the plant by river and helping London meet its target to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill sites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s a structural concrete job, for which we used over 60,000m³ of concrete,” said Project Director, John Russell.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Last year, we wrote an article for the Concrete magazine and I think the society realised that we should be applying for the awards this year. They came to the site a few months ago following our shortlisting in the category,  inspected the facility and viewed some of the further concrete information we had on display to help the judges make their decision.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain was named the winner at a ceremony at London’s Landmark Hotel, Marylebone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In their comments, the judges noted that the project was “a huge logistical exercise”, describing as impressive “the co-ordination of the concrete supply and works, not only for the slipform but also the infrastructure and ancillary construction. The scale of the slipform and the intricacy of ensuring the cast-in items were incorporated as the pour continued required total control.“</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from the basic building’s structure – half of which is underground – precast elements and in-situ concrete decking were used to create access routes for vehicles bringing waste from both the riverside berth and from landward.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Promanex, Costain’s industrial services Company, has reached seven years and over half a million man hours without a Lost Time Accident at a UK Refinery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The achievement represents a significant milestone in Promanex’s health and safety programme, which prides itself on achieving the highest level of safety in the workplace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Promanex has worked on the site for over 20 years. Ian Tully, Divisional Manager, leads a 40-strong team that carries out civils and building maintenance work as well as supporting from within other parts of the Promanex business, the delivery of adhoc/project industrial specialised cleaning activities using tankers that are designed to handle hazardous waste material. Promanex also provides specialised industrial support services during T&amp;I (Turnaround &amp; Inspection) plant shutdowns which includes the provision of safety standby personnel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Geoff Hunter, Civils and Industrial Services Director, said: “We are very proud of reaching seven years without a Lost Time Accident which reflects the commitment of our employees to working safely in complex and difficult working conditions. The commitment from every member of our team towards health and safety has been outstanding.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">29 November 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Adrian Mitchell will soon be able to assume the title of Doctor after successfully completing a post graduate doctorate on the construction industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adrian, a Planning Manager, took nine-and-a-half years on a part-time basis to complete his studies through the Faculty of Science and Technology in the Department of the Built Environment at Anglia Ruskin University (ARU) in Chelmsford, and recently received confirmation that his examiners have recommended that he be awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. The recommendation is expected to be ratified by the University’s Research Degrees Sub-Committee on 6 December 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Witnessing first-hand how main contractors were taking on greater responsibility in managing certain aspects of the design process from the designers in order to reduce fragmentation, Adrian decided to explore this area in much greater detail.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He examined the relationship between the design and construction processes and how they, and specifically the interface between them, could be better understood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adrian’s final report is a doctoral thesis titled: “A conceptual model of the factors that influence the interface between the design and construction processes.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adrian started by reviewing existing theoretical models of the design and construction processes and from here produced an initial conceptual model of the interface. This model was then tested against pilot and live case studies on numerous Costain projects to allow Adrian to produce a tried-and-tested final model. Adrian’s model is based on a coherent understanding of the processes, factors and linkages that occur at the interface of design and construction and, while contributing to the industry’s knowledge of the interface, also provides a methodology that Costain can use on design and build projects to improve its service to customers.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The design and construction processes are generally viewed in isolation, which is not how they occur. The importance of the interface between these processes has not previously been widely recognised, therefore my research conceptualises the factors that influence it. A better understanding of these processes gives us a platform to improve our operational performance,” said Adrian.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adrian is now arranging for the various copies of his thesis to appear in the ARU library, the ARU Institutional Repository, the British Library and Costain’s Knowledge Centre. A final ARU awards ceremony will take place in autumn 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on Adrian’s award, Bill Hewlett, Costain’s Group Technical Director, said: “It’s a fantastic achievement and well deserved for the huge amount of dedication Adrian has given. The work is highly significant to our business and we will be able to improve our customer offering by using Adrian’s findings and his insights into design and build management.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">28 November 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Customers are now receiving a faster, more efficient service from Costain’s Geotechnical Services Division (GSD) following the acquisition of an inexpensive technical ‘fix’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GSD engineers working on remote sites with no network connection have always found themselves fighting tight deadlines to file their logs with clients, who usually require reports within 48 hours. Until recently, this has required the engineers to fill in hard copy forms, but they then faced the problem of getting them to their destination within the time limit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The problem has been solved with a new type of ‘ruggedised’ tablet computer that can stand up to outdoor conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“All our clients want 48-hour log turnaround,” explains Geotechnical Engineer, Desmond Owens. “If I’m on site with a piece of paper I can’t get it to the office in time, so I’ve had to find a fax machine every morning or evening and fax the report across to our office, where we double up on the work as somebody would then have to transcribe it.” That is not always a straightforward process as even a small trace of mud on the paper form appears as a black smear when faxed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The ruggedised tablet PC has a touch-screen facility. I just go into Excel, fill in the details and e-mail it to the office. We can now get reports or worksheets across to clients within 24 hours. It’s definitely faster and a lot more convenient for me.” Photographs can be sent to clients to illustrate the reports or to GSD colleagues if seeking advice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An added benefit is that engineers now have access to Costain's intranet, iCosNet, while out on site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The idea was suggested by fellow Geotechnical Engineer, Alexandros Simantirakis, who used the first of the PCs on several London sites, while Owens is working with one on the A556 road project in Cheshire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The machines and their peripherals cost less than £2,000 apiece, plus the monthly cost of a 3G communications card and Owens believes they will quickly pay for themselves in terms of much-reduced time spent transcribing reports. There is also a considerable carbon saving through much-reduced paperwork.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">24 November 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has staged the first of what will become a regular series of ‘safety weeks’ on Crossrail’s Bond Street project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The events are designed to keep site safety in the forefront of the workforce’s minds and help ensure that everyone goes home safely at the end of the day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When complete later this decade, Crossrail will provide a route from Maidenhead in the west through twin-bore 21km tunnels under central London and out to the east, forking to Shenfield, near Brentwood in Essex and to Abbey Wood in southeast London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At Bond Street, Costain, in a joint venture with Skanska, is constructing two large station boxes that will reach five levels below ground. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has been involved in similar safety weeks on Thameslink, the other major rail project underway to improve rail connections through London; there, one contractor took overall responsibility for each week-long event, said Bond Street Project Director, Isabel Coman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first Bond Street safety event was “very much a joined-up affair between us, Crossrail, the other contractors and the design team at Bond Street”, she said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One highly successful component of the week involved site personnel sitting in the cabs of the large trucks and plant that are employed on site, allowing staff to understand the fields of view that the drivers have around their vehicles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A day of manual handling training sought to tackle what remains one of the biggest causes of site-related illness, while another aspect of the week saw speakers present some of the latest safety products relevant to construction sites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An actors’ group role-played various scenarios that allowed staff to correct their potentially unsafe behaviours, while briefings on empowerment helped personnel understand how they could raise safety-related concerns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It was a real first in terms of the Crossrail scheme,” said Isabel. “We will be having a ‘lessons learned’ session and we look forward to the next one in January.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">23 November 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work to create a new level of resilience for London’s electricity supply is well underway as Costain continues to build the shafts and tunnels for the London Power Tunnel (LPT) project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is responsible for the civils work for the LPT project, a major project for National Grid to create tunnels that will house a new generation of 400kV electricity cabling. A tunnel will run from Willesden in the west of the capital via Kensal Green to Hackney in the east. From Kensal Green another tunnel will be driven south to Wimbledon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are a total of 14 shafts, of which four have been completed with the next four currently being dug at a rate of around one metre a day. The last shaft will be completed in early 2012 and they will all reach depths of up to 40 metres. At the foot of the three launch shafts, launch tunnels are dug to act as the starting points for two tunnel boring machines (TBMs) to begin cutting their way through 32km of routes under the capital. (The tunnels are a mixture of 4m and 3m internal diameter).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Headhouses that will contain mechanical and electrical equipment are being constructed atop all the shafts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Around 90% of the ground through which the tunnels will be driven is London clay, the ideal material for tunnelling due to its stability and ease of cutting.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first TBM arrived in the UK in mid September and has been lowered into the launch shaft at the National Grid site in Eade Road, Haringey, ready to start digging this month. Tunnelling is expected to be complete in 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">National Grid describes the tunnels as ‘a new subterranean electricity superhighway’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Given the congestion under central London’s streets caused by existing utilities and Tube tunnels, the new routes have been carefully planned to avoid these obstructions and to minimise settlement on these routes. However, says Costain’s Tunnelling Operations Director, Stephen Meadowcroft: “One of the key challenges is to liaise with all the third parties involved well in advance of any tunnelling.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 4m TBM has been named 'Cleopatra' after a competition to choose a suitable name was held at the local cub scout group close to the Eade Road site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cub scouts have already visited the site to see ‘their’ TBM. “With visits like this we can show youngsters first-hand how our work makes life as we know it possible,” said National Grid Head of Cable Tunnels, David Luetchford.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Hopefully some of our visitors may even be inspired to pursue a career in engineering when they are older.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">22 November 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Geotechnical Services Division (GSD) has expanded its portfolio of activities with the introduction of waste consultancy services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The move fits in with the recent steady expansion of Costain’s services, from its traditional role as a construction and engineering Company, to a full solutions provider.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With increasingly stiff penalties being levied on organisations that incorrectly dispose of waste materials, GSD’s latest service has proved increasingly popular since it was set up six months ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Initially we would check the source of the material and site history and apply the correct European Waste Code”, explained Senior Geotechnical Engineer, James Dodd.  When the correct European Waste Code has been applied the material can often be classified as non-hazardous or hazardous with no further action being taken.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aside from these clear-cut decisions, some are trickier, said James.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“There are certain sources of material known as ‘mirror entries’ that can be either hazardous or non-hazardous, depending on the concentration of dangerous substances they contain. We get laboratory testing carried out and check it against the relevant thresholds to determine if it’s hazardous or non-hazardous.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Most of GSD’s work in this new field comes from Costain project teams that move on to a brownfield site to start a contract and need to find out if they have hazardous materials on site. GSD undertakes site investigation work, taking samples for analysis to determine the levels of contamination: “Project teams will contact us to carry out soil sampling and are often surprised by the service we can offer,” said James.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">21 November 2011</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Costain’s flood alleviation works at Mythe Water Treatment Works (WTW) have gained international attention following a Central American ministerial visit.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Parliamentary delegates from El Salvador, who included the equivalent of the UK’s Environment Select Committee, visited the Severn Trent Water facility at Tewkesbury as part of a trip to see how the UK manages flood emergencies. </p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">El Salvador has recently suffered torrential rain and flooding in which at least 30 people have died, 50,000 people have had to leave their homes and another 250,000 have been affected by the conditions. Mythe WTW was the subject of extensive protection measures by Costain following the floods of 2007 that swamped the works and left 350,000 local residents without clean water supplies for 10 days.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The visitors were interested to learn how the UK plans for, manages and recovers from flooding. They hope their visit will help El Salvador’s ability to tackle the impact of future inundations.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Severn Trent Water’s Programme Manager, Sad Buray, commented that while the 2007 UK floods had been mild compared to events in the Central American nation “it became clear during the visit that there is a mutual understanding and appreciation of the challenges we face with climate change and the need to plan for large storm events”.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Hosted by the Environment Agency, the delegation was briefed on the agency’s flood warning service, the UK’s 2007 floods and their impact on Tewkesbury and the wider Gloucestershire area.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Costain’s Site Agent, Chris Vice, showed the visitors around as they inspected the new flood defences, which included embankments, concrete walls and sheet piling, timber-clad to help it blend into the landscape.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">“It was a look round to see what had happened and what had subsequently gone on to ensure the treatment works remains operational in future,” said Costain’s Community and Liaison Manager, Jacqui Bolsover.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Although Costain completed the bulk of the work at Mythe some time ago, further flood alleviation measures are due to get underway imminently. A related flood compensation scheme involving the removal of a disused railway embankment nearby is also planned to be delivered next year.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">18 November 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, primary contractor for Evaporator D the UK’s biggest Nuclear Project, has pledged £10,000 to the Cumbria Community Foundation in order to establish the Costain Community Fund.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company will also pledge £5,000 for every year the construction Company operates within the area – beginning next year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain currently employs over 100 people within the Cumbrian area and works with over 30 local sub contractors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cumbria Community Foundation will be working closely with Costain to establish the Costain Community Fund – which will be open to local charities and organisations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rob Phillips, Costain Project Director, commented: “We are really pleased to be able to commit £10,000 to West Cumbria. As a Company we always like to provide a legacy in the areas in which we work. The initial fund plus the £5,000 pledge annually is going to make a significant difference to local community projects and charities across our area”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking on behalf of the Cumbria Community Foundation, Andrew Beeforth OBE, Director, said: “I’m delighted to welcome Costain as the Foundation’s newest fund holder.  I hope that together we will make some valuable awards in the local community.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Local MP, Jamie Reed, commented: "Costain's generous donation to Cumbria Community Foundation - more importantly the local community is great news. I'm pleased to see one of our local employers investing in the community. I look forward to seeing the benefits to local charities and community groups alike."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cumbria Community Foundation is a local charity that, with the support of donors, like Costain, has made grants totaling over £16million since inception in 1999.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain believes the £5,000 annual donation will make a significant difference in the area. Costain is committed to supporting the local areas in which it operates.  </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">16 November 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Five local charities have benefited from the Costain Welsh Water Framework’s success at the 2011 Dwr Cymru Welsh Water (DCWW) Annual Occupational Health and Safety Awards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After winning the top Occupational Health and Safety Excellence Award in June for an unprecedented second consecutive year, the Welsh Water framework team were given £2,500 and asked to suggest a good cause to donate the money to.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cheques of £500 each went to Wales Air Ambulance, the Special Care Baby Unit at the Countess of Chester Hospital, Nightingale House Hospice, Happy Faces (a local charity that provides help to sick, disabled and disadvantaged Children who live in the North Wales Area) and the North and mid Wales Branch of SENSE, a national charity that supports and campaigns for children and adults who are deafblind and also support people who have sensory impairments with additional disabilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Natalie Bailey, a representative for SENSE, said: “We would like to thank Costain for its generous donation. The money donated will go towards arranging an arts and crafts day with the families that SENSE supports.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Angie Lopez, Fundraising Administrator for the Countess of Chester Hospital, said:  “Thank you for the generous donation to the neonatal unit fund. The department is in the process of ordering a new reclining chair for the unit. This will be gratefully received by both the staff and parents as it will enable them to get closer to their babies at what is a very stressful time.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Framework Director, John Madden, who presented the donations, added: “For the second successive year we are delighted to be able to support five local charities in North Wales. It gives me great pleasure to meet with the charity representatives and to hear in more detail about the difference that our donations can make. Let’s hope that we can provide the same support next year through our Health &amp; Safety performance at Welsh Water.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">15 November 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s £397million project for the design and construction of a network of state-of-the-art recycling and waste management facilities across Greater Manchester is nearing its conclusion. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since 8 April 2009, when the Company’s contract with Viridor Laing (Greater Manchester) Ltd started, 37 of the 42 facilities have been completed including the country’s first thermophyllic Mechanical Biological Treatment – Anaerobic Digestion plant (MBT) to treat waste and produce green energy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The combination of MBT sites, In-Vessel Composting (IVC) plants, a Materials Recovery Facility (MRF) and Household Waste Recycling Centres (HWRCs) is already making Greater Manchester much greener than before.  The new plants are increasing the recycling and composting rates, producing green energy using anaerobically digested residual waste and minimising the amount of waste that has to be sent to landfill sites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The contract covers the design and build of 42 facilities spread across 27 sites.  These include 24 HWRCs, five MBTs, four IVCs, one MRF, seven Transfer Loading Stations and two Green Waste facilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The recent completion of the HWRC at Adswood Road in Stockport means the network of ‘super recycling sites’ is now in place and the satisfaction level of residents visiting the HWRCs across Greater Manchester is at an all-time high of 99.7%.  In addition the recycling and composting rate that is being achieved at these super recycling sites has increased from 21% in 2004/05 to 50% in 2010/11.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Understandably, said Project Director, John Boyd, the ultimate client, the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority, is very pleased with the impact of the new facilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the exception of Bolton IVC – work on which has only just started – the team hopes to have finished commissioning the remaining plants by Christmas but, as with all new technologies, optimisation may extend this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By the time the team finally moves off-site, it will be just under three years since the programme to significantly improve Greater Manchester’s performance in recycling and composting, diverting waste from landfill and producing solid recovered fuel to create energy got underway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On top of the technical achievement, the team has performed impressively on the health and safety front. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having just passed the 5.5 million man-hour mark, the Accident Frequency Rate for the entire contract is just 0.15 and getting better as the project nears its conclusion, with the AFR dropping to 0.05 for the last 12-month period and no lost time accidents at all so far in 2011.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">14 November 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain's Geotechnical Services Division (GSD) is adding to its steadily growing repertoire of skills by offering a new electrical safety service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Bourne End-based division has acquired the necessary equipment to carry out Portable Appliance Testing (PAT) and has trained up two staff to handle the kit. The checking of all electrical appliances in workplaces to prevent shocks from faulty or damaged equipment is a legal requirement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GSD is studying the possibility of undertaking these safety checks for external organisations, but is for now concentrating on internal clients within the Group. Its first task for the new equipment (apart from checking its own offices at Allerton Bywater) was to give the all-clear to Costain’s site at London Heathrow Airport.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While GSD is looking further afield to find opportunities for its new service, it also hopes to be able to stop a small but steady leakage of cash from within the Group by offering its new service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PAT has until now been carried out by external contractors. The hope is that, once the new capability is more widely known about, sites within the Group will lift the phone to GSD.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“If money has to be spent on testing,” says the Laboratory Manager at Bourne End, Bhavika  Ramrakhyani, “at least it’s being spent within the Group rather than outside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The idea is that we’re trying to make ourselves a ‘one-stop shop’ for a lot of services and this is one more addition to that.  GSD is still not as well-known as it should be within Costain and we’d like to change that.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">9 November 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you saw television coverage of gold medal winning Olympic rower James Cracknell and Ben Fogle rowing across the Atlantic in 2005 then you’ll know it’s not an activity for the fainthearted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But that’s exactly what Chris Walters, who works for Costain’s newly acquired company Promanex, plans to do in December.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Called The Corinthians, Chris’s team is raising money for two charities, with a third each going to Shelterbox, which provides food parcels for people affected by natural and man-made disasters and the British Heart Foundation. The remaining third will go towards the cost of the boat, The Spirit of Corinth, which has been designed and kitted out by race organisers, Woodvale Challenge, to withstand the rigors of the open ocean and, more importantly, get them across the Atlantic in one piece.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chris, 52, from Axminster in Devon, works as a plumber for Promanex, Costain’s industrial services division and heads a four-strong team aged between 51 and 66 whose steely resolve and determination to succeed has been honed from competing in numerous endurance events over the years.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The race sets off from the Spanish port of San Sebastian de la Gomera, in the Canary Islands, on 4 December 2011 and finishes in Port St Charles, in Barbados. Travelling west across the Mid Atlantic, the race is 2,549 nautical miles (or nearly 3,000 regular miles) but the distance can often be a lot further once bad weather and adverse conditions are factored in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Chris and the team train four or five times a week, often at night, but there’s very little they can do by way of training that will prepare them for the scale of the challenges ahead.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I think the older you get the more you look for a bigger challenge. You can’t really train for the mental aspect of it as nothing can prepare you for what you’ll experience on the open ocean. While it would be great to beat the record, I think we’ll be happy to finish it in less than 50 days,” said Chris.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">8 November 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Christmas shopping in the Berkshire town of Newbury will be a little brighter this year as shoppers flock to a new attraction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain-constructed 300,000 sq ft Parkway shopping centre opened its doors on 27 October, ready for the run-up to the festive season. The scheme includes a new Debenhams department store – three times larger than the retailer’s old store in Newbury – as well as a host of top retail names including a number that are new to the town such as Superdry, Topshop, H&amp;M, Argento, Jigsaw and Lakeland.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Parkway also provides a 550-space shopper car park and 147 new apartments (plus 37 affordable homes), with the first apartment due to be completed this winter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s client, developer Standard Life Investments, is delighted with the scheme so far.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A fortnight before the opening, the Costain team had largely completed the retail areas of the mall – “A lot of the tenants’ fit-out contractors are in and beavering away”, noted Project Director, David Woodhouse, at the time – and construction work was continuing on the new homes that are integrated into the project. The apartments are due to be handed over in batches in the summer of 2012.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Despite the inevitable issues associated with having a major, complex building site in the middle of a town centre for three years, the project has gone very well,” said David, “particularly considering the volume of material we have moved both on and off site. Excavation of the complex basement alone involved removing 70,000m³ of material.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We have received a great many compliments for our involvement and how we have managed our impact on the local community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The basement was an engineering feat in its own right, as a huge area had to be made secure from the high water table,” he added.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Further complexities included the installation of three lift shafts through the heart of a functioning Marks &amp; Spencer store adjacent to the site, a task that involved breaking through a secant piled wall and stripping out part of the store’s roof.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Areas of the development also included listed buildings, retained facades and retained derelict buildings that required complete refurbishment. Costain brought in specialist craftsmen – predominantly woodworkers – to handle refurbishment of timber roofs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A recent substantial variation to the John Lewis store saw the building frontage being extended out towards Victoria Park. Although an additional challenge at the end of a complex project, the team made excellent progress. “We’re contractors. We like challenges, and providing solutions,” commented David.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The sheer complexity is what I’ll remember about this job,” he added. “That and the scale of it. You really only grasp the size when you walk round and round, up and down, in and out of all the little areas at the back. It’s been hugely complicated but thoroughly enjoyable.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">7 November 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, one of the UK's leading engineering solutions providers, is today issuing its Interim Management Statement covering the period from 1 July 2011 to the current date.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Overview<br /></strong>Following the strong performance reported in the interim results announcement of 25 August 2011, the Group is continuing to perform well and trading is in line with the Board’s expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain continues to benefit from its 'Choosing Costain' strategy of focussing on targeted blue chip customers in chosen sectors whose major spending plans are underpinned by strategic national needs, regulatory commitments or essential maintenance requirements. The implementation of this strategy, enhancing the breadth and scale of Costain’s service offering to encompass consulting and care as well as construction services, is transforming the Group into one of the UK's leading Tier One engineering solutions providers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On 22 August 2011 Costain announced the acquisition of Promanex, an industrial support services business operating in the Power, Petrochemicals and Nuclear markets. The integration of this business is progressing well. The integration of Clerk Maxwell, the front-end engineering and operations support services provider operating in the upstream oil &amp; gas sector and acquired earlier in the year, is complete.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Order book<br /></strong>Following further major new contract awards during the period, including the award by Network Rail of the London Bridge Station contract announced last week, the order book has increased to £2.6 billion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As well as including in excess of £600 million revenue for 2012, the order book also provides good long-term visibility with over £1.8 billion of revenue secured for 2013 and beyond, the balance of the order book being for the remainder of 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, Costain continues to have a strong preferred bidder position, which has been maintained at circa £400 million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Financial Position<br /></strong>There has been no material change in the financial status of the Group, which continues to have a strong cash position of in excess of £100 million and no significant borrowings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Outlook<br /></strong>Whilst challenging market conditions are set to continue for the foreseeable future, the Board expects to report results for the year in line with its expectations.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">7 November 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The arrival in November of a discreet vehicle staffed by a medical professional, outside Costain’s Maidenhead HQ, signals the next stage in the Company’s drive to improve the health and wellbeing of its staff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Head office staff will be able to sign in for a 40-minute wellbeing medical covering such factors as Body Mass Index, blood pressure, pulse, cholesterol and testing for diabetes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s entirely voluntary and we are hoping to see an improvement in the take-up rate,” said Veronica Robins, Costain’s Health and Wellbeing Manager. “Traditionally, take-up for this sort of thing has been quite low. We’re not sure why; perhaps people fear that finding a problem will mean losing their job. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Safety, Health and Environment department’s drive to care for staff members’ health stems partly from an acknowledgement that health has not always been afforded the same priority as safety or the environment over the past 15 years and this situation needed to be rectified.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Veronica was appointed to her role to actively promote and improve the health and wellbeing of the Costain workforce and try to ensure that the ‘health’ element of SHE was given equal consideration to safety and the environment when undertaking any activity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain at one time had its own occupational health department, staffed by a doctor and two nurses, but it became a casualty of the difficult times the Company encountered in the early-1990s. However, the arrival of Andrew Wyllie as Chief Executive saw the subject re-establish itself on the Company’s agenda: “He’s been the catalyst for change,” said Veronica.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ironically, given the drive to reduce workplace injuries, work-related ailments are actually far more prevalent. The construction industry recorded 600,000 days lost through injury in 2009-10, but 2.6 million days lost to work-related ill health.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Musculo-skeletal disorders are one of the biggest health issues affecting the Costain workforce and whilst they can result from activities outside the workplace such as playing sport, doing DIY or playing computer games, the main causes within the working environment are poor manual handling techniques and poor workstation ergonomics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“My aim is to ensure that health isn’t compromised on-site or any existing medical condition exacerbated,” said Veronica.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Two years ago, a ‘fit for work’ medical was instituted for safety-critical workers. “We don’t legally have to do this but we brought it in after a member of our workforce fell from height and it was subsequently discovered that he had a pre-existing medical condition of which the Company was unaware. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Now safety-critical staff – such as those driving mobile plant, working at height or working on high speed road projects – are checked before they start work and have regular follow-ups, the frequency of which depends on their age.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Campaigns aimed at raising awareness of health issues are another example of the Company’s proactive approach to occupational health.  Two campaigns in 2010 focussed on the prevention of musculo-skeletal disorders and noise induced loss. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This was the first time that Costain had run health campaigns company-wide and they were very well received by project staff,” said Veronica.  “Sessions were made as interactive as possible, which made them fun as well as informative.”  Following on from the success of last year, two further campaigns are being rolled out in 2011. The first was aimed at raising awareness of drugs and alcohol issues and the second, which is due to commence in early November, will concentrate on the prevention of heart attacks and strokes and the benefits of a healthy lifestyle.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, the Company provides free BUPA membership for all staff who have been with the business for more than three years, together with discounted membership rates for their family members. The top 50 staff also receive ‘executive medicals’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the wider area of ‘wellbeing’, the Employee Assistance Programme gives staff access to a free confidential information and counselling service 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year on a range of subjects including not just health but also financial, legal or relationship issues that may have a detrimental effect on their health through worry if not resolved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s become something of a cliché to describe people as a company’s greatest asset,” commented SHE Director, Peter Fisher, “but we happen to believe it’s true and we want to take tangible measures to show staff that there’s a genuine level of concern about their wellbeing while at work.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">4 November 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Energy &amp; Process has received four coveted industry awards at the prestigious IChemE Awards for Innovation and Excellence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The awards, presented by the Institution of Chemical Engineers, recognise all aspects of chemical, process and biochemical engineering, and attract submissions from around the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Robert Smyth, a Process Engineer with Costain Energy &amp; Process, received the Young Engineer of the Year Award. Robert has both a B.Eng (Hons) in Chemical Engineering and an MSc in Chemical Process Design from Manchester University. He had previously been recognised in the 2009 NOF Energy Awards as Best Newcomer to the Industry. Robert was shortlisted with entries including BP, Sabic and Shell.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Steve Jackson, who led the development of Costain’s carbon capture technology, which was also recognised by the IChemE, received the Innovator of the Year Award. Steve is a leading authority in carbon capture and heads Costain’s technology development team in this field. Other shortlisted nominations included entries from leading academics from University of Tokyo, University of Queensland, University of Colorado and University of Singapore.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s next generation carbon capture technology received the Highly Commended Award in the Core Chemical Engineering category. The innovative process, developed by Costain, significantly reduces the amount of carbon dioxide produced by coal-fired power stations. Costain received funding from the Energy Technologies Institute in July of this year to develop the technology for advancing capture rates in a pre-combustion application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain was also awarded Highly Commended in the Chemical Engineering Project of the Year category for the Holford Underground Gas Storage project.  Costain designed and constructed the gas processing plant for E.ON’s underground gas storage facility in Cheshire. The facility will play a vital role in meeting the UK’s energy needs, with a storage capacity of up to 160 million cubic metres, with a daily withdrawal capacity to supply 3.5 million homes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain also sponsored the Education and Training award. Frank Millar, Costain Hydrocarbons &amp; Chemicals Sector Director, who presented the award on the night, said: “Costain is committed to encouraging the next generation of engineers, and places a high priority on skills and people development within our organisation.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Energy &amp; Process Managing Director, Charles Sweeney, said: “At Costain we are committed to bringing forward innovative solutions to meet the challenges facing the energy and process industry.’’ He added, “We were delighted to receive the awards from the IChemE as they are internationally recognised as a standard of excellence and achievement.’’</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">3 November 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s experience in both marine works and nuclear de-commissioning has been recognised once again with the award of a £2million contract to demolish an offshore steel sheet pile barrier wall for client Magnox, at Bradwell, in Essex. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The barrier wall stands approximately 400m offshore and formed part of the former nuclear power station’s cooling system.  Cold ‘inlet’ water was drawn from the seaward side of the wall and the warmer ‘outlet’ water was pumped out on the landward side, the barrier wall preventing the cold and warm water from mixing. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction work started at Bradwell in 1957 and generation began in 1962.  Power production ceased in 2002.  Following extensive de-commissioning works the site is due to enter a 100-year ‘care and maintenance’ period in 2015. Therafter, final site clearance can be completed.  The site adjacent to the existing Bradwell station has been earmarked by the Government as the location for one of the UK’s new generation of nuclear power plants. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The two steel barrier wing walls, each approximately 100m long, are separated by a 30m-wide concrete central section.  The sheet piles for the walls were driven 15m into the river bed back in the 1950s. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“To remove them”, said Hugh Nicholson, Costain Senior Planner, “a barge-mounted long reach excavator will open a diver access trench on either side of the piles.  Divers will then use underwater Oxy-Arc cutting torches to cut the piles into 5m panels, commencing one metre below the existing riverbed level. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The final cut to release each 14-tonne panel will be made above the water line, with the load being supported by a barge-mounted crane.  The scrap steel will be loaded onto a barge and taken to a metal re-cycling facility in the Thames.”  Costain and specialist marine contractors Red 7 are co-operating on the project. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Touch wood, it should be fairly straightforward,” said Hugh.  “Once the first few panels have been removed we should be through the learning curve, then it is a case of keeping going until all the panels are removed.”  Once the piles are removed, the access trenches can be backfilled. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Works started in mid-October 2011 and are due to complete in February 2012. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Environmental considerations have dictated that the works take place over the winter months in order to avoid any potential impact on the local oyster breeding season. </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">26 October 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A major project on behalf of Severn Trent Water, to improve drinking water supplies in Coventry, has received top marks from the Considerate Constructors Scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is the principal contractor on the project which involves the demolition of three reservoirs at Scots Lane in Coundon and the construction of a new single reservoir on the same site. The new reservoir will ensure the long-term security of drinking water to around 10,000 residents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following a second visit to the site by the Scheme, the team received a score of 4.5 out of a possible 5 in every area measured, putting the site in the top 10 per cent of construction sites in the UK and up for a national award once the scheme is complete.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With hundreds of residents living in close proximity to the site, the team has ensured that the impact of its work on those living and working close by was reduced as much as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the initiatives that were used to reduce the impact of the work on local residents included retaining the walls of the old reservoir to act as a barrier between the construction works and neighbouring gardens, and using an external specialist consultant to carry out noise and vibration monitoring to ensure the team didn’t cause any damage to nearby homes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain was also actively involved with the planning process, carrying out letter drops to more than 1,400 households, organising and hosting a public consultation event, which was attended by around 70 local residents, and meeting with local residents’ associations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the project, Costain Framework Director, Bill Lomas, said: “The whole team has worked extremely hard to ensure that any disruption has been kept to a minimum and this has been achieved by actively engaging with the local community and acting on their concerns.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>25 October 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is using Building Information Modelling (BIM) technology and systems at Bond Street tube station, in central London, to overcome potential problems in the design and construction process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BIM allows engineers to generate and manage an enormous amount of data by checking for structural, architectural and building services clashes within existing structures. It also analyses geometry, spatial relationships and geographic information, which is vital if you’re dealing with a site that comprises a large transport network and major utilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, in joint venture with Laing O'Rourke, is redeveloping the London Underground's Bond Street tube station as part of London Underground's Tube Upgrade Programme. Work is focused on the north side of London's retail hub on Oxford Street, boosting capacity and creating step free access to the station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More than 155,000 passengers use Bond Street tube station every day and that figure is expected to rise to over 225,000 with the arrival of Crossrail in 2017. The expanded tube station will include an interchange with the new Crossrail station at Bond Street.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Bond Street project is extremely complex because we’re working around live tunnels on the Jubilee and Central line tube network, therefore “clash detection” in the design stage has been one of the key areas where BIM has really helped us. Once we go into tunnelling mode, we intend to use the Cave, a virtual reality suite, to offer training to tunnelling operatives and emergency response teams including the London Fire Service,” said Beth Willoughby, Senior Engineer on the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, prior to Crossrail in 2017, the team is working to a tight deadline to replace the existing escalator at Bond Street, which is one of the oldest on the network, in time for the London 2012 Olympics. By using laser scanning and cloud point within BIM to create a 3D model of the existing escalator and the barrel that it sits in, the team was able to superimpose the new escalator design over the existing model. This helped to identify any potential clashes and solve any clearance issues, as the new escalators are larger than the old models.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“By using construction visualisation software to combine the 3D model with project scheduling we can provide a virtual construction simulation.  The software enables the programme activities to be linked to the 3D model elements to create a robust construction sequence.  This promotes understanding of the programme together with the logistical and temporary works challenges that lie ahead,” said Matt Valentine, Project Planner on the Bond Street Station Upgrade.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paul Clark-Edwards, London Underground’s BIM Coordinator for Capital Programmes, said London Underground now specifies the use of BIM on all complex projects in order to mitigate risk during the design and construction of major assets in a live working railway environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“On Bond Street we are exchanging complex 3D geometry with Crossrail and other major suppliers to improve our design, manufacture and installation process across the project. This delivers much improved multi-discipline co-ordination and streamlines our commissioning and bringing into service. The benefits are not limited to the design and construction phases of the project. The configured ‘as built’ BIM model will be exploited in the operations and maintenance regimes, beyond project delivery,” said Paul.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">24 October 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has achieved five years without a Lost Time Accident at Magnox Limited’s Trawsfynydd twin reactor, in north Wales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The efforts of the ACTUS Team, a joint venture between Costain, AMEC, Babcock and Jacobs, including the on-site project teams, subcontractors, design team, and support and leadership personnel all contributed to the outstanding health safety and environmental performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Trawsfynydd is a twin reactor station, now defueled and undergoing decommissioning, located on the northern bank of an inland lake in the heart of Snowdonia National Park, in north Wales. After operating successfully for 26 years, Trawsfynydd was taken offline for repairs in 1991. Defueling of the reactors started in 1993.  The site currently employs 218 staff, 65 agency workers and 350 contractors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Safety is the highest priority for our client and we enhanced the competence of our team by altering mind sets wherever possible so that everyone involved was empowered to challenge any HSE issue, as well as the right to stop work if they thought HSE was being comprised in any way. We are delighted to have secured this significant contract with Magnox, as well as achieving five years without a Lost Time Accident,” said Mike Sawyer, Costain’s Sector Director for Nuclear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ACTUS team recently secured a contract with Magnox to retrieve Intermediate Level Waste at the Trawsfynydd Site which will allow it to enter care and maintenance by 2016. The contract, worth £67million over five years, has been awarded under the Magnox ILW Retrievals Framework.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">18 October 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is underlining the Company's focus on innovation by investing in a latest-generation laser scanner for surveying work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Laser scanners have been available for a few years but are now much more compact, less expensive to acquire and produce better results than their predecessors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“There are a lot of specialised survey companies with these scanners but in terms of the construction industry I think we’re in the forefront of using it,” says Costain’s Senior Survey Manager, Nigel Drayton.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new Faro Focus scanner stands on a tripod and works by bouncing a laser beam off a rapidly-rotating mirror. Nigel likens the beam to a plate standing on its vertical axis and spinning around, with the scanner detecting reflections from the beam as it hits objects or terrain up to 120 metres distant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s rotating so fast that you’re capturing one million points a second. This ‘point cloud’ is so dense that it’s almost like a picture, except that it’s a three-dimensional picture,” he explains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Points in the scan are given a three-dimensional co-ordinate and this virtual copy of the scanned site can then be passed to designers working on the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The beauty of it is that you capture pretty much everything,” says Nigel. “You go out to a site, do a scan, come back to the office. Get the information you’re interested in today and perhaps six months later someone will say: ‘We need to know exactly where that building is.’” The information is logged in a database and can be swiftly retrieved.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other advantages of the scanner over traditional surveying methods include the ability to capture survey data remotely. “This has advantages in roads and highways where we are able to survey structures from safe areas without having to implement traffic management arrangements and put surveyors onto the carriageway,” says Nigel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Where we can be innovative is looking at the use of the scanner for new applications. We are planning to use it to capture condition surveys of existing tunnels both before and after tunnelling in proximity to them.  This will capture details such as water ingress and cracks and can also give you deformation and movement information.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain bought the £30,000 scanner two months ago, with one of its first tasks being to survey some of the horizontal drive on the National Grid London Power Tunnels contract (see image right), its Early Contractor Involvement work on the Heads of the Valleys roads project in Wales and the ‘Cleaner Seas for Sussex’ work around Brighton.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s a new offering for us and now we can do surveying faster, more cheaply and more comprehensively,” says Nigel.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">17 October 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A grass roof, the biggest of its kind in the country and one of the largest in Europe, is now complete on top of Southern Water’s new wastewater treatment works at Peacehaven, Sussex. Project Manager, Graham Sugrue, laid the final strip of turf, with the *4Delivery board as spectators.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Measuring almost 18,000 square metres – the size of four and a half football pitches – the grass-covered roof is designed to blend in with the natural beauty of the South Downs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The grass, grown from a special mix of downland grass seeds, has been under cultivation for the past fifteen months in Cambridgeshire.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It will be a defining feature of Southern Water’s large £300million environmental improvement scheme that will bring cleaner seas to Sussex.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once complete the wastewater treatment works will treat the 95 million litres a day of wastewater generated by the residents of Peacehaven, Telscombe Cliffs, Saltdean, Rottingdean, Roedean and Brighton and Hove to the latest EU standards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Taking almost four years to construct and following nine years in planning, the project, which also includes underground tunnelling, the construction of a new sea outfall, two new pumping stations and construction on eleven sites, will be completed by March 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alan Faherty, Senior Engineer, said:  “The roof, designed to fit in with the local landscape will be “living” - it responds, it adapts, it evolves with the landscape”.<br /> <br />Along with the construction of a new wastewater treatment works at Lower Hoddern Farm, Peacehaven, 4Delivery is also delivering 11 kilometres of new sewer tunnel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*4Delivery is a consortium comprising Veolia Water, Costain and MWH and is carrying out a programme of environmental improvement and water quality schemes for Southern Water.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">12 October 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain team working on the Dwr Cymru Welsh Water AMP5 Framework celebrated a full year on the Welsh Water Five Fords Wastewater Treatment Works (WwTW) site, as well as reaching over 100,000 man-hours on site without a RIDDOR incident, with a hog roast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work on the Five Fords site was suspended during lunchtime to ensure the entire on-site workforce could join in the celebration and the invite was extended to all of the Framework office staff and supply chain who have all contributed to the success over the past year.   <br />                <br />Guests were also given the opportunity to have a tour around the site and offered the chance to go inside an empty (but clean) Sludge Digester. The £23million project provides an extension to the current WwTW which is already the largest wastewater operational site in North Wales. Work involved building a new digestion plant, phosphorous removal and sludge treatment capacity, both to comply with current legislation and to ease the problems of sludge handling in North Wales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Madden, Costain Framework Director, said: “Reaching this safety milestone is a real achievement and is testimony to the quality of the team that we have working on Five Fords WwTW. It is gratifying that we have been able to celebrate our success to date with everybody who played a part in the success of the project. The site not only has an excellent health and safety record but is currently performing on budget and is on programme to be substantially complete by 31 March 2012.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">11 October 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has secured its first project within a competitive tender framework with Northumbrian Water to construct a duplicate rail crossing, in Northumberland.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The scheme will provide back up to an existing water main and prevent disruptions to water supply that could affect around more than 5,000 homes and businesses in the area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The main work involves constructing a tunnel, eight metres deep, underneath the East Coast Main Line to install a steel sleeve which will house a 450mm diameter Polyethylene Pressure Main. The existing 12” under-track crossing will also be relined with a HPPE liner. Trenchless technology will be used to carry out this work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The work will reduce the likelihood of a burst water main underneath the railway line, which would require permission from Network Rail to access their land in order to repair it, as well as any potential compensation for any disruption to the East Coast Main Line.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ben McCormac, Project Manager for the scheme, said:  “We are delighted to have been awarded our first contract under the Infrastructure Framework agreement with Northumbrian Water. We secured the work through a rigorous and structured approach to identifying and assessing the risks and opportunities. This would have been a much more demanding exercise had we not had the support from our supply chain combined with the team’s previous water experience.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">10 October 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Doncaster-based engineer, who works for Promanex, the recently acquired Costain Company, is heading for Dubai next month to represent Great Britain in the Dubai Sevens rugby tournament.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Simon Marsden is training seven days a week as he prepares to join a team being entered by the British Amateur Rugby League Association (BARLA).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rugby enthusiasts will be aware that the Dubai tournament – the world’s biggest Sevens event  – follows rugby union rules rather than the rugby league code but BARLA put forward a team last year in the International Veterans category that did well enough for the association to repeat the experiment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I’ve not taken part in the Sevens before and it’s the first year I’ve been picked for the GB squad,” said Simon. “Last year the BARLA Bulldogs got to the quarter-finals, losing to the CNCF charity team that many famous ex-internationals play for, including Austin Healey, Dan Luger and Gregor Townsend, who went on to win the International veterans category. Not bad for ‘the other code’ and we hope to do better this year.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Simon is Regional Engineer in Water Services with Promanex, the industrial support services specialists. Based at Dunscroft in Doncaster, he has played rugby league for around 25 years and was a semi-pro with Keighley Cougars in the late 1990s but now plays for Keighley Albion in the amateur ranks, as well as representing Yorkshire over-35s.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, his preparations for the Dubai event are anything but amateurish.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Normally I train six days a week. It might be old man’s rugby” – the Veterans class is for over-35s – “but it’s still full contact. I still play with 18 to 20-year-olds, so I have to keep in shape.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During the rugby league season, during which he plays as a winger, he has competitive games every week. He has now stepped up his training to every day of the week to be ready for the Dubai event.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To compensate for older legs the Dubai International Veterans category, which has attracted 16 teams, has teams of 10. As well as the Sevens tournament, the BARLA Bulldogs will also be playing the Pakistan rugby league team in a full international to help promote the game in the Asian nation.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">7 October 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Company, ClerkMaxwell, has made two significant appointments to bolster its service offering and growth plans for its business streams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Experienced offshore oil &amp; gas industry figures Martin Wills and Peter Lowe have joined the Company to fulfil specific specialist services and subsea roles respectively – and both have a remit to broaden ClerkMaxwell's service provision to clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Martin, who has joined the business as Head of Specialist Services has 25 years' experience in front end and operational support roles, both with consultancies and major operators. Most recently he was in a process management role at Maersk Oil and Gas in Denmark.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Our essential commitment is to maintain and enhance the provision of a high-quality differentiating services to our clients – we're looking to bring in new people to augment our existing capabilities," he says.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"We’re committed to adding value to our services to clients by engaging closely with them to help achieve the optimum operational and commercial gains of their project, rather than just providing a one-dimensional service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It's important to have a real understanding of their project objectives from the outset, and to be prepared to challenge them constructively during that early dialogue. By doing so we are able to deploy all our experience, expertise and knowledge on their behalf to ensure we are doing all we can to help them achieve those objectives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"My own professional principles very much reflect those of ClerkMaxwell, and that's why I'm pleased to be part of the organisation. Those leading the Company are engineers first and foremost – they have a real understanding of the front-line work and that gives us the firmest of foundations for growth."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peter, who previously worked in a subsea project management role with Shell, has 25 years' subsea experience, primarily in design and execution and latterly in front end engineering and design (FEED).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"My priority is to use my background in project management and engineering to help build a new capability within ClerkMaxwell," says Peter, who has become Head of Subsea and Pipelines.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"ClerkMaxwell's subsea project support has to date focused primarily on feasibility and concept work. We are now extending that quality service offering into the next phase of support: FEED work as well as project management and execution.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Becoming part of Costain, which is committed to increasing its activity in upstream sectors, not only makes that a very viable proposition, but an exciting new prospect. Our strategy is to grow our capability within ClerkMaxwell while pursuing project opportunities, all the time supported by the resources and commitment of Costain."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Aberdeen-based ClerkMaxwell delivers multi-discipline engineering, project management and asset support services to super majors and independent operators in the oil and gas industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ClerkMaxwell’s service portfolio includes feasibility &amp; conceptual engineering; front end engineering &amp; design; detailed design &amp; procurement; subsea &amp; pipelines engineering and project management; facilities &amp; operations support and specialist services.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Together, Costain and ClerkMaxwell have access to over 500 engineers and project managers, and have an industry leading front end capability of 100 highly qualified and experienced engineers.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">5 October 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has led the UK with the introduction of a new type of density measurement gauge that both makes the Company greener and frees it from some onerous bureaucracy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Geotechnical Services Division (GSD) has taken delivery of a new generation of dielectric measuring gauges. By calculating the degree of resistance encountered by an electro-magnetic beam as it passes between two rings, the gauges can measure the density of soil, asphalt or other materials under examination.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The instruments have a self-contained Global Positioning System to provide precise location information, operate on ubiquitous Windows software and can download results electronically. They are also lighter and significantly easier to handle by staff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The arrival of the new gauges – the first in the UK – has made life considerably simpler for GSD staff as it allowed them to phase out earlier-generation nuclear-powered gauges.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The old instruments contained americium and caesium isotopes and operated by measuring a beam of neutrons passed from one to the other.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the amounts of radioactivity involved were extremely small, the mere fact that they were radioactive necessitated considerable precautions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s not that dramatic, but they had to be held in lead-lined boxes all the time and the operators had to wear film badges that were sent away every month to determine any exposure to radiation,” said GSD’s Cheadle Lab Manager, Nathan Busby.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“There was a ton of bureaucracy involved because they had to be stored away from personnel, the Environment Agency had to come and visit us once a year, we had to have a licence and the police and fire brigade had to be informed wherever they were in the world.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even police anti-terrorist branch officers visited GSD premises periodically to check on the equipment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was also the potential for causing a radioactive spill if, for example, one had been run over and crushed by a vehicle on site. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Everybody erred on the side of caution because obviously there was a safety aspect to them,” added Nathan. “We’re now taking that risk away.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Their removal allows Costain to become more environmentally-friendly as well as freeing considerable amounts of administrative time.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">4 October 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The M53 Bidston Moss Viaduct Strengthening Project, with Costain as principal contractor, has achieved another significant milestone with the viaduct restored to full structural capacity three months earlier than the 31 December 2011 contract deadline.  The whole of the structure is now capable of carrying the full HA and 45T of HB traffic loading allowing the historic weight restrictions to be removed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This considerable achievement has been recognised by all stakeholders involved, Andrew Watson,  Highways Agency NW Director commented: “This is great news and a huge milestone for the project to achieve. The fact that it has been achieved three months early is evidence of how well the project is being delivered. Everyone involved in the project (organisation and individual) should take a great deal of credit in getting this 11 year old problem on the network solved.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The achievement is particularly notable given the hazards and the challenging working environment.   The complex critical strengthening work required world leading box girder design innovation and over one million man hours and 100km of new weld in extreme confined space conditions to strengthen the 3.7km of steel box girder. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Equally satisfying to delivering the main scheme objective early was the way in which it’s been delivered,” said Costain Project Manager, Simon Ellison.  “It’s been a focussed integrated team effort from day one, the fact that the strengthening has been handed over completely defect free and without any lost time accidents demonstrates the capability and commitment of all those involved.  In line with our original promise we have maintained the M53 motorway at maximum capacity during all peak times and we haven’t had a single traffic delay complaint throughout the life of the project.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The integrated ECI team comprises the Highways Agency (also representing Merseytravel and Wirral Council), Costain (principal contractor), Amey (designer), Cleveland Bridge UK – strengthening, Denholm – access / blasting / painting and VVB for all power and electrical requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Completion of the strengthening work has now released all follow on refurbishment activities such as painting, drainage, lighting renewal, cathodic protection, joint replacement and other highway works.  Off peak M53 and local road traffic management will continue to be utilised until the end of the contract to facilitate these refurbishment works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The £89.9million project remains on target to be the first scheme of its type to be completed on time and within budget in spring 2012.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">3 October 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Costain-Skanska joint venture has handed over the first major civils contract to Crossrail, the UK’s biggest rail infrastructure project, after completing the construction of the Royal Oak portal, in west London, nearly one month ahead of schedule.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In what is a major achievement for the project team, which had to work in a restricted space surrounded by live rail and tube lines, tunnels, bridges and utilities, including live overhead power lines, the Costain-Skanska joint venture formally handed the completed project to the client at the beginning of September.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Crossrail is a new 118 kilometre high frequency rail route that will run from Maidenhead and Heathrow, in the west, through new twin-bore 21 km tunnels under central London, before forking at Stepney Green for Shenfield near Brentwood and Abbey Wood, in southeast London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Royal Oak portal near Paddington, in west London, will be the transition ramp for trains entering and exiting the central London tunnel. Prior to entering the tunnel, trains will traverse along a gradual gradient for several hundred yards. Bordered by the A40 Westway to the north and the Hammersmith and City line and Network Rail to the south, the team had to work in a narrow corridor which was 22 metres wide at its widest point and one kilometre in length, which meant that getting the logistics right in terms of manpower, materials and machinery was critical for the success of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We were no more than three metres away from the Hammersmith &amp; City line on one side and the A40 on the other, with three bridges overhanging at the side, so space was extremely tight. Another big challenge for us was in mobilising the cast for the diaphragm walls as we needed three cranes and two piling rigs, which is a lot of heavy machinery to have in such a confined space,” said Vicknayson Thevendran, Project Manager for the scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A total of 25,000 m<sup>3</sup> of ground was excavated to construct the portal. At the deepest end of the ramp, a concrete headwall was constructed with a pair of 7.24 metre diameter tunnel ‘eyes’ which were created for the installation of steel rings that will support the tunnel opening when the tunnel boring machines break through the headwall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Royal Oak tunnel portal is the first of five to be completed on the Crossrail route and will act as an entry point for the tunnel boring machines that will start constructing the Crossrail tunnels next year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain-Skanska secured the job in 2010 as part of an advanced works civils framework contract, which is a four-year programme of works totalling £100million. The joint venture team is also working on a second Crossrail portal at Pudding Mill Lane, near the London 2012 Olympic site at Stratford, which is due to be handed over in 2013. Crossrail services are due to commence from late 2018.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">28 September 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just over one year after taking up triathlons, Costain Energy &amp; Process Senior Project Engineer, Tim Fletcher, will shortly be pulling on a Team GB vest as he competes in the sport’s European Age Group Championships.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What makes his achievement notable is that before taking up triathlons – a combination of swimming, cycling and running – he had never competed competitively in any sport.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He earned his place in the British team that will compete in Eilat, Israel, in 2012, for amateur European titles. At the same event professional sportsmen will be seeking Olympic qualifying performances. The European standard distance event consists of a one-mile open water swim, followed by a 40km cycle ride and a 10km run.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His swift rise began after a bet with his brother-in-law at Christmas 2009 that he would enter 2010’s Liverpool triathlon. After enjoying this event in June 2010, he continued training during the winter 2010 and tackled four more such events this year; cumulating with third overall in the Scottish Olympic Distance National Championships, a qualifier for next year’s European event.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Fletcher, currently working at Costain's Manchester office on the CSL Easington Terminal Works project, processing North Sea gas from the York field, says he’s “always kept fit, but never competitively competed in sports."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I’m fortunate enough to be able to cycle to work, which I do three times a week. That helps. I also swim in the mornings and go running in the evenings two to three times a week. Of course, I decided to wait until I was in my mid-thirties and I had a young family before taking up three time-consuming sports!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Understandably he says he is delighted at his progress and, with the European Championships not far away, “I’m very much looking forward to training hard and the honour of wearing my Team GB kit.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>23 September 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is trialling the use of a high-tech model boat capable of surveying the beds of rivers, lakes and even sewerage tanks that will greatly reduce health and safety risks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The laser-located boat reduces health and safety risks as the risk of drowning and exposure to raw sewage is eliminated. The built-in radar system can improve the accuracy of readings to plus or minus 10mm as it can penetrate through silt to uncover true bed and concrete levels, which can save time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The boat was trialled at the Five Fords WwTW Project for Dwr Cymru Welsh Water where the team needed to accurately establish the concrete base level of two very large live aeration tanks that treated sewage at the site near Wrexham.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Traditional methods would have seen the company employ a dip survey around the perimeter of the tanks but this wouldn’t have measured the key central area, said Tim Hall, a senior Design and Third Party Manager working on the Welsh Water project.  “Alternatively, someone would have gone into the water which increase the health and safety risk, either through drowning or through bacterial contamination,” Tim said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The bathymetric survey is cost effective and achieved in considerably less time than employing alternative methods. It gave us several hundred spot levels across the large tanks while not putting anyone at risk of drowning or bacterial infection,” said Tim.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>22 September 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ACTUS, a joint venture of AMEC, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc, Costain and Babcock, has been awarded a contract worth up to £67 million over four years, by Magnox Limited.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The work has been awarded to the ACTUS joint venture as part of an Intermediate Level Waste (ILW) framework contract and involves decommissioning across three waste streams  - solid wastes, wet wastes and FEDER (Fuel Element Debris Enhanced Retrievals) at the Trawsfynydd site in North Wales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The groundbreaking approach within the nuclear decommissioning industry has set exemplary standards for decommissioning nuclear facilities.  It has been assessed by ‘Constructing Excellence’ as an exemplar of multi-partnership working within the nuclear sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dave Wilson, Trawsfynydd’s Site Director, said: “This is a significant award and one which will help Magnox deliver the site into early care and maintenance - in line with our Optimised Decommissioning Plan.  We look forward to working closely with the ACTUS JV.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Darren James, Costain Managing Director, Infrastructure Division, said: “This is just the start of the next series of challenges similar to those the team has already successfully navigated at Trawsfynydd.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“ACTUS understands the bar is now raised even higher and there will be no complacency in the pursuit of the client’s goals our work will help achieve.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>19 September 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is raising the capability of project management across the Group by supporting its people to gain a prestigious industry designation that recognises their ability to successfully manage a complex project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is sponsoring 17 people from across the business to attain the Association for Project Management’s (APM) Registered Project Professional (RPP) standard which, in conjunction with the Company’s Project Management Academy, aims to meet customer demands for project competence while addressing the need for succession planning in the project management community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“In line with our strategy to meet our customers’ needs, the Costain academy has been instrumental in up-skilling our managers to demonstrate competence and deliver complete solutions. Our customers are increasingly demanding whole-of-project capability and it’s very likely that the RPP standard will in the future become increasingly important for further advancement and for winning more work,” said Jeremy Galpin, Costain’s training and talent manager.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The APM is a registered charity with around 19,000 individual and 500 corporate members, making it the largest professional body of its kind in Europe. As part of its bid to raise awareness and standards in the project management profession it is currently applying for a Royal Charter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As part of the process participants have to demonstrate a capability in 29 core competencies, including leadership, stakeholder management, communication and teamwork, as well as knowledge of 18 complementary competencies.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once completed, a RPP-designated project manager means the customer can be confident the individual has been externally assessed as competent and is dedicated to their own continuing development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For John Meakin, Operations Director in the Energy &amp; Process division and a project manager at E.ON’s gas storage project at Holford, the RPP programme is a major step forward in recognising the knowledge and skills required to operate as a high performing project manager.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The core competencies are well defined and give a clear indication of the complex nature of project management. I feel this programme sets a high level professional benchmark for project managers which will be recognised by our peers, employers and customers,” said John.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Shafali Shown-Keen joined Costain in 2008 after working in the finance department of an investment house specialising in tax leases. After working in the PFI and Treasury department, Shafali was seconded to the Corporate Strategy team to work on mergers and acquisitions. Shafali believes that gaining the RPP designation is the next logical step in her career.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The APM’s RPP lifts project management to the highest level. It will give me a competitive advantage and prove that I am a responsible leader with the ability to manage a complex project. It also complements our ability to offer complete solutions across the Group,” said Shafali.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many of Costain’s customers, like BAA, Network Rail and Crossrail, already recognise RPP as an industry benchmark that has raised the standard for project management, as a profession, to the highest level.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Vicknayson Thevendran, a project manager on the Royal Oak Portal project for Crossrail in west London, said RPP gives customers the confidence that a person has the necessary competence to manage large complex multi-faceted projects, from inception right through to completion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“RPP provides clients and employers with confidence that the person with RPP experience has the necessary competencies to manage the project successfully,” said Vicknayson.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting, Andrew Bragg, the APM’s Chief Executive, said: “The extensive profession-wide consultation which underpinned the development of RPP makes us confident that it represents the new gold standard for assessing project management competence. It recognises excellence in project management so I am particularly proud that a leading organisation of Costain’s stature is placing our pan-sector standard at the heart of its project management activity.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">16 September 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Offshore Europe, held last week in Aberdeen was ClerkMaxwell’s first exhibition as a new Costain Group company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Held every two years, the exhibition was attended by over 50,000 people and is the largest oil and gas event held outside North America.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event was opened by Charles Hendry, Minister of State. In his keynote speech he highlighted that 2011 had seen a significant number of new fields approved in the North Sea and that UK companies would have a key role in their development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Customers attending the event included Shell, BP, Petrobras, ExxonMobil, Centrica and BG with attendees travelling from as far afield as Australia, Brazil, China and the US.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event gave conference delegates the opportunity to meet with ClerkMaxwell and Costain staff and discover more about the company's multi-discipline engineering, project management and asset support services capabilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to exhibiting at Offshore Europe, ClerkMaxwell also hosted two networking receptions at Aberdeen Grammar Rugby Club, where ClerkMaxwell is the principal sponsor. The receptions were well attended by a number of key customers and industry stakeholders.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Wilson, Managing Director ClerkMaxwell said, “Offshore Europe gave ClerkMaxwell the opportunity to engage with industry decision makers to highlight our full project lifecycle capability and the innovative solutions we’ve delivered for our customers.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frank Millar, Sector Director Hydrocarbons &amp; Chemicals added: “After acquiring ClerkMaxwell earlier this year, Offshore Europe provided an ideal platform for ClerkMaxwell to promote their enhanced offering to its customers with the backing and support of Costain.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>15 September 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has broadened the scale and scope of its business through the acquisition of Promanex, an industrial support services business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The acquisition, which is Costain’s second in six months, will enhance its existing care and maintenance offering, and help to meet the growing needs of its customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Promanex provides Costain with access to new markets, customers and services in the strategically important power, nuclear decommissioning and petrochemical market and, more crucially, provides it with a solid footing in the facilities management sector, which is an area that Costain is looking to strengthen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Darren James, the managing director of Costain’s Infrastructure Division will be responsible for the business, while Tim Bowen, Costain’s Highways Director, has been appointed as Integration Director with the task of looking at ways of cross-selling what Promanex does into the wider Costain business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This acquisition fits in perfectly with our wider Group strategy, which is to broaden our customer offering in care and maintenance.  An integrated approach is required by our large blue-chip customers as they look to award larger and longer contracts to fewer more capable support services business on a combined design, construct, operate and maintain basis,” said Tim.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Promanex, which operates in the facilities management, repair, maintenance and general asset management sector, will broaden Costain’s customer offering and help generate significant growth in volume and profitability as a result of being able to offer through life-cycle asset management to its customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Operating across the UK and Ireland, Promanex’s customer base includes a raft of blue-chip companies like Conoco Philips, EDF, E.ON, Magnox, RWE and SSE.  The business provides a range of services in the management, operation, maintenance and repair of customers’ sites and plant assets, including hard and soft facilities management, water services, such as water treatment and hygiene, specialist industrial cleaning and outage support, as well as mechanical and electrical services such as power station materials, bi-product systems and emission treatment systems.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Promanex’s Managing Director Mark Dixon, who will become Sector Director for Industrial Services, said: “We have shared ambitions with Costain, not just to grow the business but to provide excellence in health and safety and in service delivery.  We have a strong customer base as well as proven capabilities in our chosen areas and, combined with Costain’s consulting, maintenance and experience of project delivery, believe it significantly enhances what we can offer our customers.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has transformed its business in recent years, through the implementation of its ‘Choosing Costain’ strategy, from being just a civil engineering contractor into one of the UK’s leading Tier One engineering solutions providers.  A key part of the strategy has been to align itself more closely with its blue-chip customers in key chosen sectors where spending plans are underpinned by strategic national needs, regulatory commitments and essential maintenance requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain already derives around 25% of its overall revenues from support services-related activities, with around 12% of its earnings generated from the care sector.  Costain also has serious ambitions to grow the care and maintenance side of its business and to double its profit over the medium-term.  The acquisition of Promanex, which employs over 1000 people, along with the acquisition of front-end engineering and operations support services business ClerkMaxwell in April, provides Costain with a firm base from which to realise those ambitions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Promanex will help drive our Industrial Services capability and further strengthen the skills and services currently retained within the two companies, particularly that of facility management and core maintenance services that are performed by our highly skilled people,” said Tim. </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>13 September 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is close to handing over a newly refurbished main runway at Manchester Airport, after using a new surfacing material for the first time on the UK mainland.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The £18.6 million contract involved Costain renewing the ground lighting on and around the 3km-long, 45-metre wide runway and resurfacing it in the process. This involved closing the main runway five nights a week, with aircraft using the secondary runway while Costain personnel worked on the renewal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The project driver was the wiring and cabling around the runway, which was getting towards the end of its design life,” explained Project Manager Paul Hancock. “One of the knock-on effects is that we had to cut up the asphalt surface and re-lay it.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project involved installing ducting around the edge of the runway and laying new lighting cabling in it. From these ducts the team then saw-cut channels 120mm deep to the runway’s centreline where they installed the lighting that helps guide aircraft.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team also installed a new electricity sub-station for the lighting system.<br />Cutting into the runway meant that resurfacing also had to be undertaken. “We planed off 50mm of material and then replaced that,” said Hancock. “One of the main innovations is that we’re using a new French product called BBA (Béton Bitumineux Aéronautique). It’s widely used abroad, but Manchester is the first mainland UK airport to use it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Whereas with new runway asphalt you normally have to cut grooves into it to help water drain off and improve friction, BBA is self-draining and has instant friction characteristics when it’s laid.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BBA has aroused considerable interest: “Lots of other UK airports have been here, looking at it,” said Hancock. Some 20,000 tonnes of material were used in the resurfacing programme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work on the runway began in January and has continued five nights a week, from Sunday to Thursday. Costain took possession of the runway at 9.30pm, and handed it back by 6:30am. “The time allowance was never exceeded as a result of meticulous planning and programming”, said Hancock.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the civils side of the job was fairly straightforward, he added, three factors complicated matters.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although the main runway was closed, some taxiways from the secondary runway had to be kept open to allow flights to continue: “Aircraft have to taxi across my worksite to get to the terminal and, as we have to do work on the taxiway entrances, there was a complex sequence of closing them.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly, the excavations found many underground obstructions and services that were not marked on any drawings and plans or were detectable using traditional cable avoidance techniques or newer Ground Penetration Radar surveys.  Finally, the runway had to be left scrupulously clean at the end of work each morning. Even quite small stones, if sucked into a jet engine, can cause considerable – and expensive – damage. Ensuring the runway was clear involved up to a dozen sweeper vehicles and careful checking of the surface before it was handed back.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One unlikely vehicle to appear recently on the runway was a double-decker bus.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was carrying around 50 councillors representing the airport authority, together with local residents groups’ representatives, who were given a tour of the work. Hancock and airport representatives provided the commentary as the group undertook a two-hour visit: “We’ve had some good feedback,” he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The runway is due to be handed back in late October, when all the commissioning of the new systems is complete and the client’s new ILS (Instrument Landing System) becomes operational.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">7 September 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain and joint venture (jv) partner Ferrovial Agroman have handed over the final batch of four secondary schools and three secondary special schools, under their contract to revitalise educational provision in Bradford and the surrounding area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Co-locating Special Educational Needs (SEN) pupils on the same campus as mainstream pupils means that children can share facilities and fosters an integrated educational system. The buildings have been designed to provide the SEN specialist teaching facilities, an inclusive approach that also maximises benefits and efficiencies through the sharing of facilities, and supports Bradford’s policy for SEN inclusion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The four schools are:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Grange Technical College, designed for up to 1,806 pupils and Southfield Secondary Special School with 160 SEN students; </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• University Academy Keighley, which changed to an academy part way through construction and was formerly known as Greenhead High School, and Beechcliffe Secondary Special School, (1,080 plus 100 SEN);</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Beckfoot School and Hazelbeck Secondary Special School (1,610 plus 120 SEN);</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Hanson School, which includes a special Hearing Impairment and Visual Impairment facility (1,980).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of the schools are now fully operational, with ICT and facilities management services being provided by Amey.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The jv’s client for the £177million Design and Build contract is Integrated Bradford, a Special Purpose Company in which Costain is also a partner. The end client is City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain and Ferrovial Agroman have moved into the post-completion phase of the contract, which involved initially moving pupils from their existing schools into the new facilities. This move will allow some of the old buildings to be refurbished over the next 12 months, whilst others will be demolished, with the cleared sites being used for a variety of purposes including playing fields.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The final batch of newly-completed schools, which have been well-received by both teachers and pupils, posed some interesting technical challenges for the design and construction teams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The local topography meant that most of the schools were built on steep slopes. The most complex was University Academy Keighley, which Costain’s Education Sector Director, Jerry Williams, describes as being built on a “really awkward terraced site” with sports pitches on the top terrace, a running track on the central level and the school buildings on the lowest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Underneath the pitch and running track we have installed a huge attenuation tank, the size of a football field, to deal with the extreme water run-off you get coming across the site because it’s a hillside,” he explains. “Rainwater fills this tank that then empties very slowly so you don’t get torrents going down the valley.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">6 September 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain Carillion JV, working on behalf of the Highways Agency to improve the M1 motorway between Junctions 10 and 13, has trialled the use of pioneering new aerial photographic technology that will speed up planning and progress reports by allowing the user to highlight potential problems much faster and in far greater detail than traditionally manned aerial photography.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Named swingletCAM, the device is a ready-to-deploy micro aircraft with an 80cm wingspan and a built-in high resolution camera.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Powered by a rechargeable lithium-polymer battery, the craft has an on-board GPS and flight plan that is set via computer. The craft weighs less than half a kilogram and is so light it is launched by hand, as well as land autonomously on any surface without a parachute or landing net. Its small impact energy also reduces the risk of third-party collision damage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The artificial intelligence incorporated in the senseFLY autopilot continuously analyses data from the Inertial Measurement Unit and, from the on-board GPS, takes care of all aspects of the flight process. The flight plan can be pre-programmed in the project office and then launched from a pre-determined position. Users can even alter the trajectory of the device during the flight with a simple drag and drop on the computer. Additionally, it can be used for 3D photogrammetry surveys and can be overlaid onto maps such as Google Earth.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stuart Fagg, a Land and Engineering Survey Manager for the Costain Carillion JV M1 Junction 10-13 Improvement Scheme, said swingletCAM took just five minutes to photograph the entire works on Junction 12. The photographs were available immediately after landing and the photos were then stitched together to provide an overall view of the works with 100% coverage.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’ve just trialled swingletCAM and the potential to transform and improve our planning, recording and tracking procedures is very exciting. It can be deployed in a matter of minutes and delivers instant results which, on a wide range of projects, could prove invaluable. It’s a safe system, significantly more environmentally friendly and more cost effective in comparison to traditional methods of aerial photography. The high quality of the images along with the positional information gathered means we can obtain a far greater knowledge of the site than we do from traditional aerial photos,” said Stuart.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">31 August 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Kyle Clough and Mike Field have both been elected to the Council of the Institution of Civil Engineers and now aim to use their knowledge and experience of the civil engineering industry to further promote it as a profession and raise the profile of valued technicians in the workplace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ICE Council is the governing body of the Institution which meets five times a year to discuss the strategic direction of the body and to set policy on matters such as education, training, qualification and issues concerning its role as a 'reservoir' of knowledge in the field of civil engineering.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Council members, Kyle and Mike are tasked with ensuring the ICE is properly governed and is fulfilling its duty, as laid down by Royal Charter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kyle, who works as a Project Manager on the M1 Junction 10-13 Improvement scheme, has been appointed as a Council member representing the East Midlands, while Mike, a Senior Works Superintendent with over 40 years of experience in supervising major civil engineering projects, has been appointed to the ICE’s General Council.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mike and Kyle are both Fellow members of ICE and maintain strong links with the Institution, having served in various roles over the years.  Kyle became increasingly involved in ICE as a member of the East Midlands Engineering Knowledge Sub Committee (EKSC), first as Chairman and then as Chairman of the East Midlands region. Mike is a Technician Member (TMICE) Fellow and sits on a panel that feeds back to Council on ways to increase the profile of technicians in the workplace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“My aim is to enhance the professional profile of engineers by demonstrating their importance to society, politically and publically, whilst ensuring that the ICE provides increasing returns to its members,” said Kyle.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on his appointment, Mike said:  “I am delighted to be elected to the ICE Council and I look forward to continuing the good work the Institution does in promoting civil engineering. I also hope to raise the profile of valued senior frontline supervisors who see TMICE accreditation as a professional qualification that is recognised throughout the world and not just in the UK.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mike and Kyle will both serve three-year terms starting from November 2011.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A group of nine employees from across the Costain Group recently signed up to take part in the Prince’s Trust annual cycle ride – Palace to Palace – helping to raise funds to change young lives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The youth charity, which celebrates its 35th anniversary this month, helps young people move forward with their lives.  It provides practical and financial support, developing key work place skills such as confidence and motivation.  It works with 13-30 year olds who have struggled at school, have been in care, are long-term unemployed or been in trouble with the law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Palace to Palace is one of the ways in which the youth charity raises funds for its work and this popular bike ride takes cyclists along a 45 mile route between Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle.  Last year 3,000 people took part raising over £250,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Catherine Warbrick, Corporate Responsibility Director, said of Costain’s involvement in the event:  "Palace to Palace is a great way for our employees to help raise funds for this worthwhile cause."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Prince’s Trust Partnership Manager, Marion Walker added:  "It’s so amazing to see how quickly Costain has come on board having recently become Patrons of the Trust and our construction and business Services Leadership Group." </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain employees taking part are:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ross Agnew<br />Andy Clarke<br />Ian Dixon<br />Steve Jakes<br />Emma Laverty<br />Dan Rennison<br />Amy Shuffleton<br />Catherine Warbrick<br />Tracey Wood</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">22 August 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, one of the UK's leading engineering solutions providers, is pleased to announce that it has acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Promanex, an industrial support services business providing facilities management, installation, repair and maintenance and general asset management in a number of high growth, specialist markets such as Power, Petrochemicals and Nuclear.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The consideration for the acquisition, together with management retention payments, is £16.4 million. In addition, the business is being acquired with normalised net debt of £2.4 million. The acquisition is being funded from the Group's existing cash resources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Based in Warwickshire, Promanex operates across the UK and in Ireland with a workforce of over 800 highly skilled maintenance employees. The company's client base consists largely of such major blue chip customers as Conoco Phillips, EDF, E.ON, Magnox, RWE, Scottish and Southern Energy, Siemens and Total.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The business provides a range of services in the management, operation, maintenance and repair of customers' sites and plant assets, including hard and soft facilities management, water services, such as water treatment and hygiene, civil and industrial services, such as civil engineering, specialist industrial cleaning and outage support, and mechanical &amp; electrical services such as power station materials handling, bi-product systems and emission treatment systems. Approximately 75 per cent of Promanex's revenues are generated from long term contracts and the business has a robust order book and strong pipeline of opportunities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the year ended 30 September 2010, Promanex reported revenue of £56.2 million, EBITDA of £2.4 million and operating profit of £1.8m. Gross assets as at 30 September 2010 were £20.8 million. The acquisition is expected to be earnings enhancing (before amortisation and exceptional costs) in the year ending 31 December 2011 and thereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Promanex will be integrated into Costain's Infrastructure division and the existing management team will remain with the business to ensure a successful integration and continued growth in the business. The acquisition represents a further important step in implementing the 'Choosing Costain' strategy. It broadens the Group's capabilities in ongoing care and maintenance and strengthens the Group's presence in key growth target markets, particularly in Power, Nuclear Process, Hydrocarbons &amp; Chemicals and Water, where significant investment is required in order to meet national needs. The combination of Costain's existing consulting, project delivery and maintenance capability, together with Promanex's operations and maintenance services, significantly enhances the Group's ability to offer full lifecycle services to customers in these target markets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the acquisition, Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive of Costain, said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>"We are delighted to have completed the acquisition of Promanex, which represents a further important step in the implementation of our strategy of broadening our existing front-end consultancy and care and maintenance operations in order to meet customers' requirements. The acquisition will significantly enhance our existing ability to provide operations and maintenance support services to our major customers and reinforces Costain's position as a leading Tier One engineering solutions provider."</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mark R Dixon, Managing Director of Promanex, said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>"We are delighted to be joining Costain. Costain rightly has an outstanding reputation for applying technological expertise and innovation to add value to customers. Allied with Promanex's proven capabilities and market leading position in our core sectors, we will make a formidable team. Costain has an exciting future and we are very much looking forward to being a part of it."</em></strong></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">18 August 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) and its main contractors have begun a collaborative drive to develop practical strategies for supporting smaller businesses seeking work in the decommissioning sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As a first step in the process, almost 40 delegates from across the UK, representing NDA, Site License Companies (SLCs) and Tier 2 contractors (including Costain), attended a one-day workshop, in Manchester, to discuss interfacing with small businesses operating or interested in the NDA estate market and to propose possible mechanisms that would widen opportunities while bringing benefits to all parties.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Top Tier 2 contractors (those who have the highest-spend direct contracts with SLCs) across the estate had already completed a survey aiming to gather information on any existing policies or practices focused on Small to Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), defined as employing 250 or fewer employees, and local suppliers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ron Gorham, NDA’s Head of Supply Chain Optimisation, said: “The workshop was a valuable sharing exercise and it is encouraging that many Tier 2s are already actively supporting SMEs. A range of very positive proposals emerged from the discussions and I am confident these will build into some tangible actions. We are grateful for the time taken by all the participants and for the stimulating discussions.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He added that SMEs and local suppliers often offered highly specialised and innovative services at competitive costs, as recognised by the larger contractors, but, with limited manpower resources, could also face challenges with, for example, the level of documentation, compliance conditions, liability insurance, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We hope to find mechanisms that improve opportunities across the estate, not only for the SMEs but also for larger contractors seeking a specific expertise or localised knowledge,” said Ron.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After collating the feedback, the next step will be to organise a further discussion forum in the autumn, this time targeted more directly at the SME community, to ensure that the proposed actions will be of benefit and explore other improvement opportunities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among the proposals that will be shared with the SME community are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Central repository for information, eg, a web portal for estate opportunities at SLC and Tier 2 level and below,</div>
</li>
<li>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Standardisation of pre-qualification questionnaires</div>
</li>
<li>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Tier 2 open day/meet-the-buyer events</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Government has challenged all public organisations to provide wider access to their markets for SMEs. Among measureS envisaged by the Government are cutting away unnecessary red tape and improving transparency in commissioning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, the NDA’s recently published Strategy for 2011-2014 recognises the importance of a robust supply chain and responses during the public consultation period indicated that support was particularly needed for SMEs.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">17 August 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Cleaner Seas for Sussex project team has taken to the cricket field in a community match against teachers and ex-pupils of Peacehaven Community School.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The game was played on the school field, which overlooks the green roof of Southern Water's new wastewater treatment works being constructed in Peacehaven.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The game was based on Twenty 20 cricket, but with a twist - each player had to bowl two overs and batsmen retired at 20 runs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Team Captain, James York, 4Delivery's Community Relations Manager, said: "The game started with us losing the toss and as black clouds gathered on the horizon things were looking bleak. However, this soon passed as glimmers of brilliance from both those bowling and fielding, the teams seemed evenly matched. The school ended up winning what was a very close match."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ben Green, Southern Water's Project Manager, said: "Peacehaven Community School is located on the boundary to our new works and as part of our commitment to working with the local community we were delighted to enjoy an afternoon of cricket with both staff and pupils. We hope to return to the school to face another sporting challenge in the next school year."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Cleaner seas team was Southern Water's Ben Green, Nathan Jarman and James Sheldon along with contractor 4Delivery's James York, Aalok Sonawala, Nick Curtis, John Awdry, Phil Ebner, Andy Turner, Viraj Alwis and Sudesh Perera.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">16 August 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is helping Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council save time and money in the design and construction of the Harbour Way Port Talbot project, the largest transport project in Wales since the construction of the M4, by utilising Building Information Modelling (BIM) systems and technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With customers under pressure to deliver large, successful projects while at the same time working to tighter budgets and accelerated schedules, the advantage of having a three-dimensional computer programme that allows project teams to go through the whole design and construction process to eliminate as many risks and uncertainties as possible, hopefully before construction begins, carries potentially huge cost benefits. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to open in the autumn of 2013, Harbour Way will provide a 4.8 km link to the M4 near Junction 38 (Margam) into Port Talbot and the docks. The £107million scheme will serve as a vital link to West Wales, the UK motorway network, the trunk road network and mainland Europe.  Around £56.2million of the funding has come from the Convergence European Regional Development Fund and a £50.7million Transport Grant from Welsh Government.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with Arup, the designers, Costain is using BIM to generate and manage the data during the project’s construction. The programme analyses geometry, spatial relationships and geographic information, as well as quantities and the properties of construction components. Dynamic information on the construction process, such as sensor measurements and control signals from the numerous structures’ systems can also be incorporated to support analysis of its operation and maintenance. The drawings can also be viewed virtually on-screen to allow the user to pan around the project and look at it from any viewpoint whilst also being able to add or remove layers from the drawing to analyse specific details. More crucially, it allows for improved communication and understanding of the project right across the team and also allows the supply chain to contribute their views.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The starting point for this initiative is to build up the design model in three dimensions. This has the immediate benefit of being able to view drawings in 3D, which allows for a quicker and better understanding of what we are building,” said Charlie Sleep, Project Chief Engineer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Whilst this adds significant value compared to using two dimensional drawings, this is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the potential applications of BIM. By attaching other information to elements of the design model, it can be used in a whole variety of ways that brings value to the construction process and ultimately our clients,” said Charlie.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While it’s been widely used in the construction of buildings for a number of years, BIM is still relatively new to highways infrastructure. However, that’s about to change due to tighter Government legislation around funding, and companies that can successfully utilise the technology and demonstrate its effectiveness should be in a better position to win more work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“By 2016 all publicly funded projects will have to be BIM compliant and it will feature heavily in procurement marking. Therefore, if we can demonstrate, through a live project, how it works then it should score well in future tendering,” said Dan Griffith, a Project Manager at Arup.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At a time when companies like Costain, through Costain Cares, are assessing ways of reducing the environmental impact of what they do, there are also other real benefits to using BIM. The amount of waste generated can also be minimised on-site because products and materials can be delivered as and when they’re required, which reduces the need to stock pile on-site. As a consequence, the construction site is often made safer as more items are pre-assembled off-site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the project, Costan’s Project Manager, John Skentelbery, said: “The project is in the early stages but we are excited by the potential of BIM, and it will be interesting to see how much of this potential we can realise for the benefit of the project."</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Students at Longhill School tasted civil engineering life when a team of 4Delivery engineers (including Costain) which is currently working on behalf of Southern Water in Peacehaven, arrived to set them a Rapid Response Engineering Challenge (RREC).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The day-long event, organised by STEM Sussex, focused on a natural disaster – in this case Hurricane Mitch in Honduras – and showed the year nine students how key civil engineering is in such crisis situations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The students were challenged to complete different scenarios, similar to the ones faced by those in natural disasters, including the building of shelters and providing a water supply using limited resources.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">James York, 4Delivery Community Relations Manager, said: “The aim of the day was to introduce the pupils to the key concepts of civil engineering in an exciting, structured and informative manner. Using a real life example allows the pupils to see that they are surrounded by engineering everyday.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Also by only giving the groups limited resources and time they were forced to work together to complete the challenges with additional points awarded for team work.”<br />The students were advised by Costain Engineers, Alan Faherty, Joe Miller and Andrew Belson all working on the Brighton &amp; Hove 4Delivery scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">4Delivery is a consortium comprising Veolia Water, Costain and MWH, which works on behalf of Southern Water to deliver a programme of environmental improvement and water quality schemes across Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">10 August 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The A40 Penblewin to Slebech Park Improvement project, in Pembrokeshire, has won the prestigious Project of the Year award at the Constructing Excellence in Wales (CEW) awards in Cardiff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working with the client, Welsh Government, and designers Atkins and Cresswell Associates / Hyder Consulting, the team was praised for the environmental and sustainable performance of the scheme, which was also known as  the A40 Robeston Wathen bypass, particularly during the construction phase, which started in February 2009.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The judges said the project team demonstrated unrivalled best practice and partnership in the design and build of this new format carriageway (2+1) to the extent that it was almost impossible to distinguish between client and contractor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Project of the Year award is the highest accolade given by CEW and the category attracted a number of high profile projects from around Wales, including another Costain scheme, the A473 Church Village Bypass. The judges said that the quality of the submissions was so high that they had difficulty in creating a shortlist.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Around 400 people attended the fifth Constructing Excellence in Wales Awards at the Holland House Hotel.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the award, the judges said: “(The scheme’s) approach to major environmental issues and its commitment and enthusiasm in relation to the surrounding community alongside the 4.6km road was exemplified by over 600 site visits hosted for members of the public and others.   It has set new highways engineering standards in Wales.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mark Young, Costain’s Project Manager for the scheme, said:  “It was a challenging project as we had a lot to contend with in terms of reducing the environmental impact of the scheme, particularly in terms of protecting the local water quality and wildlife, but we had a great team and we’re delighted to have been recognised for this award.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In congratulating the Costain team on its award, the Welsh Government’s Project Engineer, Martyn Leech, said: "Despite some of the heaviest rain, the coldest temperatures and the deepest snow seen in Pembrokeshire for decades, the Costain team delivered the scheme within budget and, allowing for some additional re-surfacing work, instructed at the end of 2010, on programme. A comment often heard was how everyone involved in the scheme enjoyed being a part of it.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Passengers checking in at Gatwick Airport’s North Terminal are now treated to a three minute time lapse video of the construction of the interchange facility built by Costain last year. The £25million project connects the forecourt and shuttle train to the North Terminal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The large video walls displaying the time lapse video are located at the ends of the busy check-in aisles in the centre of the terminal next to the security entrance. The snowy weather of the winter can clearly be seen as the construction team battled on to complete the project early.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The North Terminal handles some 14 million passengers a year. All of whom use the new interchange.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">8 August 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Local residents in West Yorkshire celebrated the reunion of their communities, after the completion of a new bridge across the M62, with a special ribbon cutting ceremony to mark its reopening, attended by local schools, community leaders, Costain, Lafarge May Gurney, A-one+ and the Highways Agency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Whitechapel Bridge carries the busy B6120 and connects the town of Cleckheaton and the village of Scholes, which were cut off from each other for nearly a year while the new bridge was under construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are four schools in the immediate vicinity of the bridge, which generate a high volume of pedestrian and vehicle traffic. Residents in Scholes had to take a two-mile detour to get to the other side of Whitechapel Road while the new bridge was built.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The scheme was project managed by A-one+, a joint venture comprising Costain, Colas and Halcrow as part of an Area 12 MAC contract. Work started on the scheme in February 2010 with the diversion of utilities away from the old structure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once all the telephone, electric, gas and water services were diverted from the existing bridge, the main works started in August.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The previous bridge comprised 32 individual pre-cast concrete beams with an insitu reinforced concrete deck, arranged in four spans across the M62 on three piers. The bridge suffered from alca-silica attack, particularly around the half joints, which made any future maintenance simply unviable. The only option was to replace the bridge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The demolition had to be carefully planned due to the old bridge containing asbestos, therefore the use of explosives was ruled out. All 32 beams were removed individually by a crane and were broken up off-site under controlled conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Extensive planning was required with Yorkshire Water to construct the £1.5million water sewer diversion, which involved serving notices to local landowners and construction of a 160 metre long 1.8 metre diameter tunnel under the M62.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the project, Highways Agency Project Manager, Sujad Hussain said: “It was a well planned and executed project which very much involved the local community.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Peter Bamfield, A-one+’s Project Manager, said: “It was a pleasure working with the people of Cleckheaton and Scholes. It was important that we caused the minimum amount of disruption to local residents, which is quite an achievement considering we had to close the motorway on 12 occasions.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">4 August 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A major improvement in the environment for residents living alongside the A556, in Cheshire, is on the way as Costain progresses work on preparing for construction of a new road.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This will be a 6.5km-long dual carriageway linking M6 Junction 19 and M56 Junction 7, on which Costain is working on an Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) basis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new road is due to be one of the first major Highways Agency projects to go through the new Infrastructure Planning Commission process, which was introduced under the Planning Act 2008.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“A lot of people live alongside the existing A556. It’s an extremely busy road which passes directly through the villages of Mere and Bucklow Hill,” says Costain Project Manager, Richard Stuart. “It’s a fairly poor environment for the people who live there and by taking away the road from the existing route it will improve their living conditions as well as the safety and capacity of the A556.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additional benefits will include improvements in water quality to Rostherne Mere, which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and Ramsar site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Around 5.5km of the new road will be offline, primarily through farmland, which will necessitate environmental mitigation measures including habitat provision and crossing points for protected species. There will be a small online section on the existing road, plus a new junction at its northern end.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As might be anticipated these days, the project is already being affected by significant cost considerations, although under the ECI system, an agreed target cost will not be put in place until shortly before construction, which is planned to commence prior to 2015. The Highways Agency (HA) budget for the project is £174million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even before Costain’s involvement the HA had to undertake a value engineering exercise to bring the project’s cost back within budget. Additionally, says Stuart: “The Highways Agency has been challenged to provide 20% savings across major projects over the next five years. We’ve been challenged with delivering the A556’s contribution towards that saving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Identification and realisation of cost savings will go on throughout the project, with an emphasis on efficiency measures above scope reduction; we’re working with the supply chain to make sure the design is buildable and the most economic solution.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the new road is complete the existing A556 will be ‘detrunked’, reduced to a single carriageway in each direction and handed back to Cheshire East Council.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">4 August 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain team working on the Dwr Cymru Welsh Water Framework is celebrating after once again winning two top awards at the fifth annual DCWW Health and Safety Awards. The awards were presented at a glittering ceremony held at the Liberty Stadium, in Swansea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For an unprecedented second consecutive year, the Costain team won the top 'Occupational Health and Safety Excellence Award' after beating intense competition from other companies working with Welsh Water.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The prize for winning the ‘Occupational Health and Safety Excellence Award’ is a charitable donation of £2,500 to a local charity. In light of this, the Costain team in north Wales intends to nominate worthwhile causes based in Wales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Excellence award was judged by an independent panel of Health and Safety Consultants who commented:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain’s commitment to the continued development of its health and safety management systems is unwavering, and it has again taken health and safety risk management to a new level. Allied to this is Costain’s demonstration of active employee involvement throughout all aspects of its health and safety management process which is clearly having a positive impact upon its employees and partners. The Company should be recognised for its consistent and comprehensive commitment to health and safety and in particular its continued drive for continuous improvement.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, Works Superintendant, Ray Dennis, was awarded first place in the ‘Outstanding Contribution to Health and Safety’ category. Commenting on Ray’s award, the judges said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Ray is a worthy winner as he shows commitment to the health and safety cause way above the call of duty. As well as carrying out his day to day role as Works Superintendant, Ray has actively taken on a mentoring role for other members of the construction team with particular focus on health and safety.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Madden, Costain Framework Director, said: “The Costain team at Welsh Water is delighted to once again be recognised by Welsh Water for our commitment to health and safety. In particular, I am really pleased for Ray that his efforts to promote the highest standards of health and safety have been recognised by a blue-chip client.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">2 August 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has made a positive start to the successful implementation of Costain Cares, its new operational drive to give competitive advantage in every facet of the business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since its launch at the Company’s Annual General Meeting at the beginning of May 2011, Costain has been recognised, through successfully integrating corporate responsibility (CR) into its business model and developing clear CR responsibilities and incentive structures at a board and operational level, by achieving Platinum in Business in the Community’s (BITC) 2011 Corporate Responsibility Index (CRI).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company has also embarked on an engagement drive, both internally and externally, to engage with its numerous stakeholders, including  customers, supply chain and employees, in identifying areas where it can improve and understand their priorities. Below is a link to a recent film the Company has produced which illustrates how it is engaging with its supply chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/news/videos/2011/8/2/costain-cares---supply-chain-engagement.aspx">Costain Cares - Supply Chain Engagement video</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s employees are its most valuable asset and that is why the Company has rolled out an extensive Employee Engagement Survey. This will allow its employees to play a key role in shaping the future of Costain. The Company is now in the process of reviewing the results and identifying areas for action, which is a fundamental part of how the Company will demonstrate and deliver Costain Cares to its employees.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has also become a Patron of the Prince’s Trust and its Construction and Business Services Leadership Group, and will support the Trust in achieving its goals of helping over 50,000 young people get their lives working again this year, as well as helping to shape training opportunities around skills shortages and job opportunities across the construction industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Catherine Warbrick, Costain Corporate Responsibility Director, said: “Costain Cares is an ongoing process that will help define and guide how it conducts itself, from building relationships with its stakeholders, to securing new orders from major customers and delivering profitable solutions through innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“As was discussed at its launch in May, those companies that adhere to greater corporate and social responsibility will be more successful and offer greater returns to shareholders and the communities they serve.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For this reason, the Company is developing a number of challenging targets that, once signed off by the Board, will be released in October.  The targets will cover a number of areas, including safety, health and environment under the direction of Costain’s Safety, Health and Environment Director Peter Fisher, supply chain management under Group Commercial Director Patrick Bruce, community and customers under Alex Vaughan, the Corporate Development Director, and employees under the direction of Christina Wade, Costain’s HR Director.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Cares is now central to its business and the Company is committed to making it a success. It will be measured by third party assessment to help the Company reach its potential, as well as set its strategic goals for the future.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">2 August 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has been awarded a contract to provide cryogenic expertise on a Front End Engineering Design (FEED) study for FLEX LNG’s fixed floating LNG production project for operations in Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The FEED contract was awarded to the KANFA Aragon/WorleyParsons joint venture FirstLNG by Samsung Heavy Industries Co. Ltd on 27 May 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has been working in partnership with KANFA Aragon for a number of years, delivering concept, pre-FEED and FEED studies for LNG floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team recently launched a joint marketing campaign, offering all aspects of design and supply of LNG FPSO topsides, including technology licensing, FEED, detailed design and procurement. The campaign was launched at the Gastech exhibition in Amsterdam in March of this year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The field specific FEED is scheduled to take six months, progressing to a Final Investment Decision. The study will develop the generic FEED work previously carried out by KANFA Aragon and Costain for the development of an LNG processing and liquefaction topside with a capacity of up to 2.0 mtpa of LNG.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain will continue to provide cryogenic expertise based on the Company’s extensive experience in the design, supply and operation of cryogenic gas separation and liquefaction plants, including N<sub>2</sub> cycle technology for LNG, air separation and synthesis gas processing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frank Millar, Costain Hydrocarbons &amp; Chemicals Sector Director, said: “First of a kind projects like this bring a range of complex engineering challenges, which require the formation of specialist teams to address them. We are pleased to bring our cryogenic expertise to the team designing the world’s first floating LNG project.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The ability to produce LNG at the point of extraction will mean many remote offshore gas fields will become economically viable for the first time,” added Charles Sweeney, Managing Director of Costain’s Energy &amp; Process division. “With the global demand for LNG ever-increasing, this technology is set to revolutionise the energy industry.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">28 July 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s £90million Church Village Bypass Scheme has scooped a top award for cutting carbon and improving energy efficiency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain was presented with the Waste Minimisation Award 2011 at the Constructing Excellence in Wales Awards at the Holland House Hotel, in Cardiff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The award was for the eco-friendly programme of works at the Bypass where it was recognised that the largest contribution to the scheme’s carbon footprint would arise from construction materials, the fuel consumption of plant and machinery and the potential disposal of waste to landfill.  The management team aimed to reduce the environmental impact of the scheme from the start. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A staggering 300,000m3 of soil was excavated and less than 0.01% of site generated waste was actually diverted to landfill.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Council’s Cabinet Member for Transportation, Customer Care and Emergency Planning, Cllr Andrew Morgan, said: “The statistics of the Church Village Bypass speak for themselves.  It is a massive scheme and it ticked all of the boxes the judges wanted.  The judges commented that it was exemplary in terms of all its key stages – planning all opportunities, detailed value engineering at design stage – and waste minimisation was always a priority.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Constructing Excellence in Wales winners will now go forward to the Constructing Excellence National awards which are to be held in November.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Barry Woodman, Project Manager from Costain, added: “We are extremely pleased to receive the award from Constructing Excellence in Wales which recognises and rewards the efforts made by all the team. Some very innovative initiatives together with design and engineering techniques secured impressive results.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">27 July 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain Skanska joint venture has achieved a major milestone in recording over 300,000 man-hours RIDDOR free at the Pudding Mill Lane portal project for Crossrail in East London.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">RIDDOR stands for the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (1995) and is under the auspices of the Health and Safety Executive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The portal will act as the transition ramp for Crossrail trains when entering and exiting the North East section of the central London tunnels. The project, which is part of an enabling works framework awarded in April 2010, is split over three sites near Stratford and adjacent to the existing Docklands Light Railway, overland railways and the River Lea.  Complicating the project is a network of 400 kilovolt power cables and sewerage outlets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Under construction is a 450-metre long diaphragm wall which comprises a reception chamber and cut and cover tunnel, as well as two new rail bridges over an existing river in order for the DLR to be diverted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project also includes a reinforced concrete retaining wall, the diversion of significant utilities and the realignment of the adjacent Barbers Road.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is a big multifaceted project and safety is our number one priority,” said Shaun Hazell, Construction Manager.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“To have reached over 300,000 man-hours RIDDOR free is a major achievement, and with continued vigilance from the workforce and staff, we will continue to target a RIDDOR free completion of the project,” said Shaun.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">26 July 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, one of the UK's leading engineering solutions providers, is pleased to announce that it has been awarded, in Joint Venture with Skanska, the contract to construct the Crossrail Paddington Station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project, which is worth approximately £150m, is the first station contract to be awarded as part of the £14.8bn Crossrail programme to create a new railway link between Maidenhead to the west of London and Abbey Wood and Shenfield to the East. Crossrail will boost London’s rail-based capacity by 10 per cent, delivering new journey opportunities, faster journey times and up to 24 trains per hour between Paddington and Whitechapel during the peak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Crossrail Paddington Station is one of seven new underground stations to be constructed. It will be a key interchange with the existing Network Rail services at the Paddington Mainline station and with London Underground. The new Crossrail station in Paddington has been designed to maximise the station’s space while preserving the historic features of the main line station. The new station will take the form of a 260m long, 25m wide and 23m deep underground box located directly under Departures Road and Eastbourne Terrace. Paddington will be just 9 minutes to Liverpool Street, 16 minutes to Canary Wharf and 27 minutes to Abbey Wood.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction will commence this year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive of Costain, commented:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“We are delighted to have secured our fourth Crossrail contract, reflecting our ability to consistently deliver valuable solutions in the rail sector utilising our broad range of capabilities and depth of expertise. We look forward to working with Crossrail to deliver this landmark station and to playing our part in enhancing London's transport infrastructure.”</strong></em></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">25 July 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has won the Thomas Brassey Award, given annually by the Institution of Civil Engineers for the best overall project in South East England.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 4Delivery (4D) consortium that includes Costain, Veolia and MWH, took the title for its work in expanding sewerage network capacity in Canterbury with minimal disruption to the historic city centre.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Canterbury’s population, of just under 50,000, is due to rise by around 20% over the next four years due to a surge in housebuilding. All the City’s wastewater flows drain to the main wastewater treatment works (WTW) and there was concern from provider Southern Water that with the growth in households sewerage capacity would be insufficient, leading to a risk of flooding and overflows into the River Stour.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Southern Water had originally planned to build 4.4km of additional trunk sewer to the WTW. This would have meant laying large-diameter sewers throughout the city centre and main shopping areas, creating widespread disruption.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead, 4D proposed an alternative involving a new offline pumping station that would pass wastewater flows to the WTW, an additional 2,500m³ of storm tank storage at the WTW, plus 900m³ of offline, underground storage located in the catchment area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The pumping station would drive water from the trunk sewers along a new, 650-metre pipe into the new storm tank storage, from where it could gradually be released into the WTW as the peak storm flow subsided.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A critical early hurdle to overcome was the completion by the end of November 2009 of a 15-metre diameter, 10-metre deep shaft for the new storm tank, to allow Canterbury Theatre Society to erect a marquee adjacent to the site in which to stage pantomime.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Failure to have completed the shaft in time would have resulted in having to stop major works for two months, with inevitable cost implications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another complication was negotiating a compensation package with tenants living on a local travellers’ campsite, through which the pipeline had to run.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction work on the £11.5million project began in October 2009 and was handed over, on schedule, to Southern Water in November 2010. The project came in under budget and without a single lost-time accident or environmental incident in 85,000 man hours. With 4D donating 30p for every safely worked man-day, this resulted in two local charities – Canterbury Sea Cadets and the Ataxia-Telangiectasia Society (which seeks a cure for this neuro-degenerative disease) – each receiving more than £1,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To win the Brassey Award, a project must have delivered benefits for the community through the application of a range of engineering principles; innovative design and construction techniques; enhancement of the surrounding environment; and with no injuries to the workforce.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">* The full citation for the successful project is shown below:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The overall Thomas Brassey Award recognises the best project in the Branch and was named after that most eminent 19th century Civil Engineer. <br /> <br />We choose to name our Engineering Excellence Awards in his memory, both because of his tremendous impact on civil infrastructure across the world - from railways, to marine telegraphy, to water supply and sewage systems - and because he lived in our Branch area towards the end of his career. <br /> <br />To claim the award, a project must have delivered benefits for the community at large through the application of a range of engineering principles - coupled with innovative design and construction techniques - to ensure that the surrounding environment is enhanced - whilst protecting the workforce with an impeccable health and safety record. <br /> <br />This must be achieved within the constraints of both budget and programme.<br /> <br />The verdict from the judges was, for once, unanimous and there was a clear winner, scoring highly in all of the judging categories.<br /> <br /><strong>The Winner of the Thomas Brassey Award is Canterbury Growth Scheme.<br /></strong> <br />This £11.5million project has increased sewerage network capacity in Canterbury and reduced the risk of flooding and pollution as the City continues to grow. The original proposals, to construct over 4 kilometres of new sewers, were value engineered by the project team and delivered significantly under budget. They decided to reuse the existing network and construct new offline storage capacity. In doing so, they saved money, avoided massive disruption and preserved the historic streets and the archaeology of Canterbury. Health and safety was always a top priority and was rewarded with a perfect safety record – not a single lost time accident. The project supported the local community - donating money to local charities – and supported local third sector organisations in addition to delivering direct benefits to residents. The projects value engineering not only reduced costs but delivered environmental benefits too – a 75% reduction in CO2 over the life cycle of the scheme."</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">21 July 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Charity fund-raising and the final leg of the Tour de France are firmly on the agenda for one Costain person.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paul Clough, Construction Manager for Water Compliance Ultraviolet Disinfection Schemes, on behalf of Southern Water, and nine acquaintances are tackling a route from Chobham, Surrey to Paris… then cycling straight back again in a bid to raise a total of £10,000 for their collective charities. Paul’s chosen charity is Naomi House Children’s Hospice, near Winchester. The group of riders have timed the end of the first leg of their fundraising ride to coincide with the climax of the Tour de France. “If we get mixed up with the pros, they’ll soon overtake us!” comments Paul.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He discovered Naomi House when delivering a previous charity cheque to the Hampshire hospice and was struck by the incredible work they do for terminally ill youngsters and their families.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The round trip is due to take six days, with the team setting off this month (July) and aiming to average 60 to 80 miles a day. The first night will be spent in Newhaven before taking a ferry to Dieppe, then overnighting in Beauvais, halfway from the coast to Paris.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sadly, the team will have little time to enjoy the City of Light, even its famous cuisine. “We’ll have a bit of a celebratory meal – really a case of getting as many carbohydrates into us as possible – then it’s back on the bikes early next morning for the return. We’re gluttons for punishment,” says Paul.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I’m not an avid cyclist. I bought a racing bike from a friend a couple of years ago and sadly it has been sat in the shed for at least a year. Even today, work commitments mean I can really only train at the weekends, when I’m currently covering about 120 miles over the course of the weekend.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’re doing the cycle without any support vehicle, carrying spare tyres, tubes and all other essentials on our backs or somewhere on our bikes. If something goes wrong it’s a case of finding the nearest bike shop and speaking our best French to get it fixed!”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyone wanting to help Paul reach his individual target of £1,000 should go to: <a href="http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/Cloughy">http://uk.virginmoneygiving.com/Cloughy</a></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">20 July 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has been selected by the Energy Technologies Institute (ETI) to lead the development of the next generation in carbon capture technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project will see a carbon capture pilot plant capable of capturing 95% of carbon dioxide emissions designed, built, operated and tested by the middle of 2015.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain will undertake the first phase of the project, lasting 16 months and costing £3.5million, executing the front end engineering design for the demonstration unit. Costain will lead work by the University of Edinburgh and Imperial College, London on the first stage, to help understand and optimise performance of the technology.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ETI expects to invest £20million in the second stage, as the pilot plant is built, demonstrated and the results analysed. Demonstration is key to building user group confidence in the capture element.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A potential site has been identified for the pilot plant, and will be reviewed and ranked against other options and then confirmed during the first stage of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The technology developed by Costain has the potential to significantly reduce the amount of carbon dioxide produced by coal-fired power stations. The technology delivers a high capture rate, while improving capital cost and power generation efficiencies, in comparison with conventional capture schemes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Development of the next generation of carbon capture technologies is a critical part of Costain’s strategy of Meeting National Needs, as it is seen as crucial to helping the UK meet its 2050 climate change targets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Charles Sweeney, Managing Director of Costain’s Energy &amp; Process division, said: “The ability to capture carbon from fossil fuel-fired power stations is vital for countries throughout the world to meet their carbon reduction commitments in the fight against global warming.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Martin Land, Costain Power Sector Director, added: “We are excited at the potential of this innovation, and its contribution to the increased attractiveness of clean fossil generation, both in UK, Europe and wider global markets.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The ETI is a public private partnership between six global industrial companies – BP, Caterpillar, EDF, E.ON, Rolls-Royce and Shell - and the UK Government tasked with developing ‘mass scale’ technologies that will help the UK meet its 2020 and 2050 energy targets. It is concerned with identifying affordable, sustainable and secure energy across heat, power, transport and the infrastructure that links them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Dr David Clarke, ETI Chief Executive, said: “Current technologies significantly increase the costs of capturing CO2 and reduce the power output or increase fuel consumption. This project will develop technology which will reduce the costs and increase performance to allow a full scale commercially viable facility to be ready for power export by 2020."</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">19 July 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has recently supported client Lancashire County Council at several public exhibitions as consultation continues on the Heysham to M6 Link road. This is part of the pre-application phase of the application to the Infrastructure Planning Commission (IPC) for development consent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The IPC is a new body that aims to streamline the UK’s sometimes lengthy planning process for strategically-important projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lancashire County Council Project Director, Steve McCreesh, said: “Not only are we likely to be the first local authority to take a scheme through the IPC process, but it is likely to be the first highway scheme as well. The exhibitions were well attended and it was very useful having the Costain members of the team with us to answer the questions about the construction process.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The IPC process covers all aspects of the proposals, including site compounds and construction routes, and therefore the Costain involvement has been essential.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain was awarded the Heysham to M6 Link project on an Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) basis in May 2010, but works were suspended to await the outcome of the Government’s Comprehensive Spending Review. Costain continued to work with Lancashire County Council to develop Value Engineering savings to help the project through the various phases of the review.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Having successfully passed through the phases of the review, including a best and final funding offer that resulted in a saving of 16% to the Department for Transport, the scheme was included in the list of nine local authority schemes to progress.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Heysham to M6 Link scheme will provide the long-awaited connection from the M6 at Junction 34 to the Morecambe and Heysham peninsula. Once completed, the dual carriageway will provide improved access for businesses located in Heysham and Morecambe, including the port and nuclear power stations, opening up large areas for regeneration and reducing bottlenecks and congestion currently experienced within Lancaster caused by traffic trying to access these areas. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Project Manager, Andrew Langley, said: “The technically challenging scheme consists of the construction of 4.8km-long, two-lane, all-purpose dual carriageway, and a further 4.8km of slip roads as part of the M6 Junction 34 remodelling. It also includes a new crossing of the River Lune on a 200m-long bridge adjacent to the current motorway bridge.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project also provides for: <br />• A 600-space park-and-ride facility at the new Junction 34 with a dedicated bus service to Lancaster;<br />• Reconfiguration of  major junctions at A589 Morecambe Road and A683 Caton Road M6 Junction 34;<br />• Several grade-separated crossings including the West Coast Main Line railway, Lancaster Canal, the A6 Lancaster Road and the River Lune;<br />• Alterations to three existing road bridges;<br />• And significant works with statutory undertakers, including diversion of two high pressure gas mains.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If all now proceeds smoothly, start date for the new road is summer 2013, with completion due in late 2015.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">18 July 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has reached the latest milestone in its programme of reinvigorating educational provision in the London Borough of Lewisham (LBL) with the topping-out of Deptford Green School.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Lewisham’s Mayor, Sir Steve Bullock, did the honours on the 4th floor of the building, which will house around 1,300 pupils when it opens on 3 September 2012. Among those attending the ceremony were LBL’s Director for Young Children Frankie Sulke , Costain’s Managing Director, Environment, Alan Kay and Project Director of the Lewisham Building Schools for the Future programme, Brian Fisher.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction on the £28million building began in August 2010 and reached the topping-out milestone in July 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The development consists of a reinforced concrete-frame plus mixed use of external fabrics, including traditional brick and block, curtain walling, timber cladding and coloured Trespa laminate panels. Internally, it contains some exciting features , such as a conference centre at the heart of the building.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The site is on two levels. “We initially constructed temporary accommodation on the upper site and decanted children from the lower site into their temporary home, allowing the team to demolish the lower-site building to make way for the new development,” said Senior Project Manager, Ray Blythe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Once completed, there will be a much-anticipated decant into the new, technically advanced building, allowing the upper school to be demolished and the land partly given over to public open space and partly to residential accommodation.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Deptford Green is a Private Finance Initiative project, with a Design and Build element, said Blythe. It has the distinction of being the first school rebuilding scheme to reach financial close since cuts in the national school rebuilding programme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A major development in the project’s community relations policy has been the holding of monthly coffee mornings for neighbours, who can drop in to see progress and talk with project staff: “We’re taking them on the same journey,” commented Blythe.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">14 July 2011</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Costain Chief Executive, Andrew Wyllie, has become an inaugural member of a UK Construction ‘Hall of Fame’ and the Company awarded ‘Best Use of Technology’ title at one of the industry’s most prestigious annual awards ceremonies.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This week's <em>Construction News</em> awards at London’s Grosvenor House Hotel formed the backdrop for the Company’s latest accolades.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The new initiative from the magazine, to acknowledge lifetime achievement or the impact an individual has made on their organisation in recent years, was a closely-guarded secret until announced at the event.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Wyllie, who has steered the Company to consistent success and a healthy order book since he took the top slot in 2005, was one of three senior industry personnel to receive the Leadership Commendation by the publication. Further industry members will be given the distinction in future years.  </p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Meanwhile, Planning and Project Controls Manager, Phil Budden, was on hand to pick up the technology prize for deployment of Oracle’s Primavera P6 planning and scheduling tool.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Earlier versions of the tool had been around for some 15 years, said Budden, “but what we’ve done in recent years is employ it as a central database that anyone on a project can access across the internet and see all the programmes for our projects in one place.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">“That allows us to collaborate with project teams from anywhere, especially when you’ve got big joint ventures on major projects.”</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Traditionally, software was installed locally on users’ PCs and it was left largely to individuals how they managed their programmes in terms of coding structure, calendar management, reporting/presentation and data security. This inevitably led to inconsistencies in the planning function.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">The need to find a better way of managing the process became more urgent as Costain increasingly became involved in larger-scale projects with teams of planners and dispersed joint venture teams.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">In 2007 it developed a new strategy to replace all its standalone planning systems with an ‘Enterprise deployment’ of Primavera P6 Project Portfolio Management, improving collaboration and consistency across project teams, said Budden.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">An Enterprise deployment refers to all users connecting to a single, central application, rather than individuals using standalone versions.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">”Recently, we’ve deployed a major upgrade to P6.7, with major improvements to stability and performance,” he added.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">This also helped support best practice, which was jointly defined by key planners in the community, delivered by bespoke training, and then supported by the Enterprise system.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify">Budden said he was delighted by the acknowledgement of the system’s virtues by industry peers. “This provides real recognition for the way we have used technology to change the way we work. It’s brilliant to get a bit of visibility and recognition that what we’re doing makes a difference.” The award, he said, would give P6 real ‘street credibility’ with clients, partners and supply chain members.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">13 July 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Personnel on the M53 Bidston Moss Viaduct Strengthening Project, on The Wirral, have achieved a significant milestone with one million man hours worked safely.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work began on site in March 2009 and over 700 days of work have been completed since then without a reportable accident.  The project team marked the occasion with a celebration for everyone who had contributed to safety throughout the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This is a tremendous achievement by the project team,” said Graham Dakin, Highways Agency Project Manager. “It is a result of everyone working together to make this project a safe place to work”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The achievement is particularly notable given the challenging working environment. The complex civil engineering project involves numerous innovative design solutions and 100km of new weld in extremely confined spaces within the 730m-long, multi-span steel box girder viaduct to strengthen its structure. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s solution allows traffic flows on the M53 to be maintained at all peak times. The 3.7km of box girder housed within scaffold containment to protect the road user, workforce and environment make it currently the largest scaffold contract in the UK.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Project Manager, Simon Ellison, is clear on the key ingredient to operate a safe site of this nature: “Without question, ‘People’ – of course, you need the right strategy and processes in place but without people engaged and pulling together in the same direction it’s always going to be difficult. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The project relies on everyone performing and behaving in the right way because they want to, so most of our safety focus from the outset has been on people: Setting the right environment and culture built on trust and respect, so that everyone has a voice to influence the project.” </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A recent anonymous survey revealed that 95% of the Bidston workforce felt they had a voice and could influence safety on site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Frank Rogers, Director of Customer Services for Merseytravel, one of the three viaduct owners, echoed the success of the approach: “Bidston Moss Viaduct is an extremely complex and difficult contract, but it has been evident from the start that the approach to Health and Safety has been exemplary.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Asked about the risk of complacency setting in, Ellison responded: “The Accident Frequency Rate measurement is just the end result and has never been our focus. We’ll continue to focus on improving safety and everything we do from the day before.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The integrated ECI team on the project comprises the Highways Agency (also representing Merseytravel and Wirral Council), Costain (principal contractor), Amey (designer), Cleveland Bridge UK (strengthening) Denholm (access, blasting and painting) and VVB (power and electrical requirements).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The £89.9million project is currently on target to be the first scheme of its type to be completed on time and below budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>11 July 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Group company ClerkMaxwell* has developed an innovative subsea equipment protection system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The system offers a new approach to protecting infrastructure from damage by dropped objects, by deploying a flexible membrane filled with seawater to act as a shield for pipelines and other apparatus.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The system was developed in conjunction with a University of Aberdeen student as part of his MSc in Subsea Engineering. Paul Killin, who has now completed his MSc and accepted a position in the Company, helped to demonstrate the feasibility of the system and take it on to the next stage of development. The system has been patented.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Speaking of his new role as a subsea engineer at ClerkMaxwell, Paul said: “Subsea is an exciting sector that is undergoing significant growth, both in the UK and internationally. It’s great to be part of it with such an ambitious, progressive company that encourages fresh thinking and new ideas.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Guy Cook, Subsea and Pipelines Director at ClerkMaxwell, said: “Working with universities benefits the Company by identifying areas for development and also helps us recruit the most talented individuals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“By creating this early relationship with Paul we’ve been able to present him with new opportunities, while at the same time bringing a talented young professional on board.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Andrew Pennington, Strategy and Business Development Director at Costain Energy &amp; Process, said: “Costain is committed to seeking innovation and ClerkMaxwell’s front-end skills and capabilities enable them to bring fresh thinking to solve challenges facing the industry.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*ClerkMaxwell delivers front-end engineering and operations support services to blue-chip customers in the upstream oil and gas. The full breadth of services includes feasibility and conceptual engineering, front-end engineering, detailed engineering and operations support for projects in the upstream oil and gas sector including topsides, subsea and pipelines. ClerkMaxwell was acquired by Costain in April of this year. </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>7 July 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s commitment to returning benefits to the wider community has been recognised by two awards from one of the UK’s biggest advocates of social responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company took Business in the Community’s Big Tick Award in the ‘Skills in the workplace’ category at a ceremony in the spectacular surroundings of London’s new Renaissance St Pancras Hotel and received the ‘Building stronger communities’ category award at a ceremony in Cardiff.  The skills award was acknowledgement of the work Costain had put into developing talent throughout the organisation.  In its entry, the Company noted that its active encouragement of talent at all levels – from basic literacy classes for local trainees to continuing development of the skills of Executive Board members – had not only strengthened its own skills base but improved its reputation among both clients and peers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The community prize recognised the efforts the Company had made while building the Church Village Bypass in South Wales.  Substantial numbers of local unemployed people were taken on to the project workforce and considerable efforts were made to maximise expenditure within the local community and small businesses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Through early involvement of the supply chain, local residents and stakeholders, the project team achieved new standards of trust, openness and community engagement with significant time, cost and quality benefits,” noted Costain’s entry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It also cited reduced costs and impact on the environment, improved safety standards during construction and reduced project duration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although Costain has had a long-running relationship with BITC and has steadily climbed the organisation’s corporate responsibility rankings, this was the first time it had entered this particular competition.  “We’ve been doing a lot of good work for quite a while, so it’s nice to be recognised,” said Corporate Responsibility Director, Catherine Warbrick.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s particularly nice because the awards were assessed by our peers. BITC ask their members to come in and consider the entries, so we’re being assessed by like-minded people.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The submission for the skills award was compiled by the 2020 Board as a project, working with Group Training and Talent Manager, Jeremy Galpin and Group Training Manager, Jon Spencer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Jon, together with Senior Engineer, Neal Carter, was on hand to collect the winner’s trophy at the award ceremony. Brian Greaves, Community Relations Manager on the Church Village Bypass, picked up the second award.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">6 July 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firefighters from the North Wales Fire and Rescue Team were invited to carry out a training rescue operation at Dwr Cymru Welsh Water’s (DCWW) Five Fords Wastewater Treatment Works (WwTW) site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is currently undertaking a £23million scheme to construct a new sustainable energy plant and deliver improved sludge treatment facilities to the existing works at Marchweil in Wrexham.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A crew from Wrexham Fire Station performed a training exercise which involved rescuing an ‘injured’ dummy from inside one of the newly constructed Digester Tanks. The aim of the training was to assess which equipment the team would use in the case of a rescue and to provide a real life scenario of rescuing people at height.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was a challenging operation due to the height of the digesters, which are 18.5 metres above ground, and having to deal with the temporary roof support structure which is currently in place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tim Williams, Crew Manager on White Watch, Wrexham, attended the training exercise. He said: “The exercise gave us an opportunity to familiarise ourselves with high rise rescue operations whilst observing on site health and safety regulations. The day was beneficial to both parties and was a good opportunity to strengthen partnerships.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paul Hunter, Costain Project Manager, said: “The team felt that the site provided a good opportunity for the Fire Service to carry out an emergency rescue operation. The visit has been extremely beneficial to our team who have been able to assess and validate the emergency access procedures that we have in place. It has also been reassuring to know that the local emergency services are fully trained in rescuing site operatives in this unique environment.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Madden, Costain Framework Director, added: “Anything that we can do to provide mutual benefit to Costain and local Welsh Emergency Services has to be worthwhile.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">5 July 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s aim to contribute to the communities it works in, through ‘Costain Cares,’ is being demonstrated in Port Talbot, South Wales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As well as building the new £107million Harbour Way road that will link the M4 motorway with the town, the Company is undertaking long-term initiatives that will benefit the wider community.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This includes revitalising children’s playgrounds, supporting the local rugby team, the Aberavon Wizards, setting up a competitive sports league within schools, and helping local theatre groups like the Port Talbot &amp; District Amateur Operatic Society.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain will also help four local schools overhaul and revitalise their children’s playgrounds after they all won an eco-competition.  Groups of schoolchildren from St Joseph’s Primary, Tywyn Primary, Eastern Primary and Central Junior School had to present their pitch to a panel from Costain, explaining why their project should be supported by the Harbour Way contractors. But instead of picking just one winner, the entries were of such a high standard that Costain has decided to help all four schools.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the community-based programmes, John Skentelbery, Project Manager for the Port Talbot scheme, said: “This project isn’t just about building a new road but investing in the people of the town and their futures. It is a real pleasure for us to be involved in these fantastic community projects.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">4 July 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Trinity School, in Lewisham, has won best Educational Project at the London District Surveyors Association Annual Building Excellence awards.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Handed over on time, and formally opened by Archbishop John Sentamu, Trinity School (originally known as Northbrook School) is the third project Costain has completed as part of the Lewisham Building Schools for the Future programme. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Within a tight residential footprint of only four and a half thousand metres, the Costain design and build team developed a 600-pupil secondary school for 11 to 16 year olds. Its curved form on plan and stepped-back storeys maximise volume whilst minimising overshadowing to the neighbouring properties.  Owing to the limited external space, the building also incorporates a second floor terrace accessible to the school staff and pupils, which can be used for outside learning. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The innovative structural design utilises flat concrete post-tensioned slabs to reduce building height but maintains building services flexibility to the soffits underneath.  The building incorporates many environmental design aspects, including flood void storage underneath and mixed mode natural ventilation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Trinity achieved ‘Excellent’ under the BRE’s Environmental Assessment Method, one of very few school building projects in the country ever to have achieved such a high score.  The building is fully accessible with ramps to all entrances, and Braille to signs internally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Lewisham Borough Building Control officers were impressed with the project’s design achieving building regulations through these innovative means and also the engagement with the school and site visits for pupils, and the ongoing liaison with the local community.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">30 June 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since the announcement of the Group’s Interim Management Statement on 5 May 2011, Costain has continued to perform well and is trading in line with the Board’s expectations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Against a backdrop of well-publicised uncertain market conditions, the Group has continued to implement its strategy successfully and has secured contracts from its blue chip customers in chosen sectors whose major spending plans are underpinned by strategic national needs, regulatory commitments or essential maintenance requirements.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Consequently, the Group’s order book currently stands at £2.3 billion, with additional preferred bidder positions of over £400 million.  As at the end of the first half, over £900 million of revenue has been secured for 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The level of tendering activity in the Group’s targeted markets of Infrastructure, Environment and Energy &amp; Process remains high.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has maintained its strong cash position in excess of £100 million, and has no significant borrowings. In addition, in order to support the delivery of its strategy, the Group has recently increased its total banking and contract bonding facilities by £90 million to £435 million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Group announced in April 2011 the acquisition of ClerkMaxwell Limited, an Aberdeen-based front-end engineering and operations support services provider operating in the upstream oil &amp; gas sector.  The integration of ClerkMaxwell into the Group is proceeding smoothly and the business is trading well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain will announce interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2011 on Thursday 25 August 2011. There will be a presentation to analysts at 9.30am on that date at the offices of College Hill: The Registry, Royal Mint Court, London, EC3.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">29 June 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, the largest provider of construction and engineering services in the UK nuclear decommissioning market, has committed to implementing the Nuclear Skills Passport* supporting the National Skills Academy for Nuclear in the launch of the scheme. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Nuclear Development Director, Alistair Smith, formally sealed the agreement at the Nuclear Industry Association’s Summer Reception.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is working across numerous nuclear sites in the UK where safety and quality is delivered by staff and sub-contractors who are suitably qualified and experienced.  The Nuclear Skills Passport scheme will help to collate and securely hold the training records and accredited qualifications for staff working on nuclear sites which will allow their credentials to be used across all nuclear sites in the UK.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paul Campbell, Costain’s Nuclear Sector Director, said: “For a company like Costain, which works across numerous nuclear sites, the Nuclear Skills Passport will be of great benefit as training and skills developed on one site can instantly be recognised at other sites making staff more flexible and useful to our clients.  This system will be of even greater value as we move forward to build new nuclear power plants when the demand for staff, with the right nuclear safety culture and training, will increase significantly”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Company Charter for the use of the Nuclear Skills Passport was presented to Costain by Jean Llewellyn OBE, Chief Executive of the National Skills Academy for Nuclear.  She said: “The system will revolutionise the evidencing of nuclear skills and is key to the implementation of nuclear industry standards.  I would urge any organisation that is operating in, or wishes to operate in, the nuclear sector to get involved by signing up to the Nuclear Skills Passport.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">* The Nuclear Skills Passport is being implemented across the nuclear industry and will become highly desirable in tendering for work as it will demonstrate capability to nuclear clients in an accredited and consistent manner.  The scheme provides secure Internet access to information on the nuclear skills database, providing a detailed overview of the training completed by individuals.  </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">28 June 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The skills of Costain and a member of its supply chain, in remedying one of the most high-profile engineering failures of the past decade, have been recognised by the industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Association of Consulting Engineers (ACE) has awarded the Gerrards Cross project the top prize in the ‘infrastructure (large firm)’ category at its annual awards in London.  </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Award is given for engineering excellence displayed in construction projects, allied to other factors such as original design work, successful delivery to time and budget and creating future value beyond what would normally be expected from a project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain became involved in the project after the headline-making collapse of a tunnel on to the live Marylebone to Birmingham rail line at Gerrard’s Cross, Buckinghamshire in July 2005. A retail store was due to be built on top of the completed tunnel structure.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain appointed URS Scott Wilson early in the process and they worked closely together to solve the engineering challenges that the scheme presented.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One challenge  was the design and engineering  involved in taking over a partly-built structure created by a third party. Around 220 metres of the 320-metre-long tunnel was retained but it was all strengthened and partly rebuilt to a new design created by URS Scott Wilson.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We took over and re-engineered the tunnel to give a fully compliant and totally robust solution,” said Costain's Project Director, Martin Baughurst. The integrated team of Costain, URS Scott Wilson and the complete supply chain worked together ensuring that the scheme was delivered safely, to programme, budget and to the client’s full satisfaction.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">23 June 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Andrew Irwin, an undergraduate engineer on the Greater Manchester Recycling and Waste Project, has featured on the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) website in a profile about the prestigious ICE QUEST Scholarship, which he was awarded, in partnership with Costain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Queen’s Jubilee Scholarship Trust (QUEST) was set up in 1977 to support and encourage education in Civil Engineering.  QUEST awards scholarships to students, graduates and ICE members in civil engineering employment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Andrew is studying Civil Engineering at Loughborough University and, with the support of Costain, has been able to develop as a young engineer, by completing placements and attending a number of training courses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The courses have helped me to further widen my skills base and on-site knowledge, giving me a greater confidence to create solutions when presented with problems,” said Andrew.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During his first summer placement with Costain, Andrew was based on the M25 Bell Common Tunnel refurbishment project, where he was able to work on a number of key areas. This provided him with a fantastic insight into the running of a major highways project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Andrew is now undertaking his industrial placement year on the Greater Manchester Recycling and Waste Project, at Cobden Street, Salford as a Site Engineer, gaining further invaluable experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Andrew further commented: “Being a QUEST Scholar and working with a company such as Costain has allowed me to deepen and expand my knowledge of Civil Engineering. I now look forward to new challenges and the exciting venture of having the opportunity to be instrumental in the shaping of our future environment.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Andy Beresford, the Project Manager on the Cobden Street site, praised Andrew’s contribution to the site team, explaining:  “Andrew proved himself at Cobden Street from day one, having taken over the site engineering duties from an experienced colleague at short notice.  He has shown particular aptitude and has been a positive addition to the site team. I am sure that he has a very promising Civil Engineering career ahead of him.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">22 June 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has set tough targets in its quest to reduce the environmental impact of its business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We recognise the environmental impact of our business and we want to do what we can to minimize and reduce that impact. Our goal is to prevent environmental damage and to conserve our natural resources,” said Amy Baldry, Environmental Manager, at Costain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These goals, while not necessarily new to Costain, are in line with the recently announced Costain Cares initiative which aims to promote a more sustainable business and address the growing needs of its stakeholders, including its shareholders and the communities it serves, through greater corporate responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Through the responsible management of materials and waste, we aim to divert as much waste from landfill as possible and ensure where possible we can reuse and recycle in a responsible way,” said Amy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A number of years ago Costain committed to the WRAP (Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme) Halving Waste to Landfill initiative. This industry wide responsibility deal aims to reduce the amount of construction, demolition and excavation (CD&amp;E) waste sent to landfill by fifty per cent by 2012. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">WRAP promotes environmental sustainability, particularly with regards to material resource efficiency and use. It aims to encourage and assist industry in diverting waste material away from landfill sites and reduce associated CO2 equivalent emissions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has set a number of Key Performance Indicators that allows it to monitor its performance and, with regards to waste, it has to date achieved great results.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The amount of waste that has been diverted from landfill has risen from 47% in 2007 to 84% in 2010, while the total amount of waste Costain produces in tones per £100,000 of turnover has dropped from 56.7 tonnes in 2007 to 49.9 tonnes in 2010.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We now have a greater focus on how we treat our materials through eliminating waste in the first place, reusing and recycling where possible and through smarter procurement, such as promoting the procurement of materials that have a higher recycled content,” said Amy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other areas that Costain is focusing on include promoting biodiversity on projects, conserving natural resources like water and reducing the impact of climate change from our operations and that of our clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2010, Costain developed and launched its climate change strategy and set a long-term target for a 35% reduction in its measured emissions by 2020, compared to a stated baseline in 2008. In 2011, Costain will target a 10% reduction in its measured emissions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To reduce the impact on climate change, the Company has pledged to monitor, report and reduce carbon emissions and, working with its customers and supply chain partners, will provide low carbon solutions to support its customers climate change targets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We all have to take responsibility for what we produce, whether its carbon emissions or plastic drinks containers, and hopefully it will go some way to reducing our impact on the environment,” said Amy.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">21 June 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">E.ON's gas storage project in Holford, Cheshire, has reached a major milestone, with first gas being introduced into the underground storage caverns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain was awarded the EPCm (engineering, procurement and construction management) contract to complete the gas plant infrastructure in 2008. The project entailed the design, construction and commissioning of the gas processing plant and associated infrastructure, including modification works to the wellheads to allow brine to be removed from the caverns and replaced by gas, to allow for gas trading.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once completed, the development will be one of the fastest delivery facilities in the UK, allowing a rapid response to daily fluctuation in gas demand. The 8 underground caverns have a combined capacity of up to 156 million cubic metres and a daily withdrawal rate equivalent to the domestic needs of 3.5 million homes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the progress being made Mike Cooper, Holford Project Manager, E.ON Gas Storage UK said: "The need for increased gas storage in the UK is well documented and Holford will have a crucial role to play in the UK's energy infrastructure. The first injection of gas really is an exciting achievement and a major milestone for everyone involved with the project."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Meakin, Costain Energy &amp; Process Operations Director and Holford Project Manager said: “From the beginning of this project, Costain and E.ON have worked as an integrated team. This approach has improved communication between the two companies, and has undoubtedly contributed to the project’s success.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This significant achievement is a testament to the hard work and professionalism of everyone involved.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Charles Sweeney, Managing Director of Costain’s Energy &amp; Process division added: “Costain is committed to meeting national needs, and the ability to store large amounts of gas is an important part of the UK’s future energy mix. This facility will increase the country’s storage capacity and help to ensure security of supply.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is on track for commercial operations of the first caverns to begin towards the end of 2011, with the remaining caverns becoming commercially available to store gas by 2013.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>21 June 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain recently won a race against time to reline a major water main on Oxford Street in London’s West End, the UK’s busiest shopping street, as part of an ongoing congestion relief project for Bond Street station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A joint venture between Costain and Laing O’Rourke is busy on a seven-year project at Bond Street station for London Underground Ltd that includes complex tunnelling work.  To protect major utilities from ground settlement, some major water mains are being relined. This has involved extensive traffic management work and the creation of a one-way system on one of London’s most prestigious shopping streets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After several months of preparation work and planning, the 21-inch water main was successfully relined at 0300 on 29 May.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 170-metres long fully welded pipe was snaked out onto Oxford Street at just after midnight. The team then had just 15 minutes to close Oxford Street to position the pipe work on the street, which enabled the final weld to take place. Costain achieved the time-sensitive task in 14 minutes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It was quite a challenging job which required extensive mitigation measures to be in place to ensure that disruption to the public was minimised, but we achieved it with time to spare. We had contingency plans in place which fortunately we didn’t need,” said Clive Loosemore, Contract Director on the Bond Street Project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Pulling the pipe took place over a two hour period and before dawn all associated road closures were lifted to allow the traffic to flow freely for the morning rush hour,” Clive said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team will have to repeat this performance twice more before the end of November, ahead of the busy Christmas shopping season.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">15 June 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Geotechnical Services Division (GSD) is further expanding its services as part of a 2011 expansion plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GSD has formed a new team specifically to focus on pavement investigations (road services) which has grown out of its increasing workload as a Managing Agent Contractor (MAC), maintaining trunk roads for the Highways Agency (HA).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain undertakes its MAC work as part of the A-one+ joint venture with Colas and Halcrow.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The move is in line with the Choosing Costain strategy, which seeks to widen the Group’s activities beyond construction to cover the full life of projects from initial consultancy to post-construction maintenance. Expanding its capabilities into new work streams is high among the priorities of GSD’s 2011 expansion plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Phil Parsons, Costain GSD General Manager, said: “We need to be able to respond to the market and with Costain being heavily involved with the MACs this has provided GSD with another opportunity to develop our services accordingly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Technical surveys for roads or structures construction form a big part of the MAC design service provided to the HA and moves GSD further into the consulting end of the work stream.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“A new team of pavement engineers has been created to provide a report writing function to complement existing site-based skills. This enables GSD to provide a full suite of Pavement Investigation capabilities."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pavement Investigation involves a technician conducting a visual condition survey to inspect the road surface, recording any cracks, fretting or loss of chips.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After this initial survey another team takes core samples bored out of the pavement. These are taken to the laboratory for classification of the road construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before the core hole is reinstated, the coring team conducts a Dynamic Cone Penetration (DCP) test to calculate the strength of the sub-base and sub-grade material upon which the road is laid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once the survey, cores and DCP test have been undertaken, the information is collated, analysed and summarised into the final report by GSD’s pavement engineers. The report helps pavement designers to understand what is causing any deterioration of the carriageway and then evaluate to what extent the road needs repairing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Julian Reece, GSD Senior Pavement Engineer, commented:  “These reports allow the HA to make informed decisions about the feasibility of potential schemes.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Pavement investigations are currently being conducted on roads in several MAC areas, but there are already plans to expand the service to other MAC contracts and possibly the airports sector.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Marcus Goldstraw, Survey Manager MAC 10, said: “GSD is providing a service where the reports are formatted to allow easy transfer to the HA’s Pavement Management System, eliminating the need to double handle the information.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">14 June 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perfect planning is a key ingredient for the Costain-Laing O’Rourke joint venture (jv) remodelling project at London’s Farringdon rail station.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is preparing the 19th century station to handle a revamped Thameslink service running north-south through the capital. This includes lengthening the platforms, building a new trainshed roof and creating an integrated ticket hall that will serve both the overground and underground lines passing through the station as well as the future east-west Crossrail link.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To do this means taking frequent possessions of the tracks at Farringdon.  A possession is railway terminology to describe a section of track that a contractor literally takes possession of in order to carry out maintenance or construction works.  The typical duration of a possession at Farringdon is 52 hours over a weekend. During this period all passenger services are suspended along that section of track.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Responsibility for ensuring everything goes smoothly lies with Possession Planners Amer Inayat and Atif Tufail. “We have two different organisations to deal with at Farringdon – Network Rail [for the overground works] (NR) and London Underground (LUL). The job we’re building is for Network Rail but because it runs through an LUL station there’s obviously an interface,” explained Atif.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">LUL is using the opportunity to undertake work on its station at the same time as the NR possessions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Generally, NR possessions last from close of services on Friday night to Sunday morning, or early on Mondays. LUL possessions usually start at 1.45am on Saturdays and run until Mondays.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, separate applications have also to be made to close the actual station, which sometimes remains open at weekends allowing the public access to use ticket machines or charge their Oyster electronic rail passes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As well as these weekend closures (and occasional longer spells over public holidays), the team frequently work during what LUL refers to as Engineering Hours and Network Rail calls White Periods during mid-week nights.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, in the case of LUL the last Tube train departs around 1am and the track has to be handed back at 4am in preparation for services starting around an hour later.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With NR the last passenger trains are at 22:30 with start of traffic again at 04:30. However, once the isolations have taken place this period reduces from 23:30 to 03:30: “We have a maximum of three hours on LUL and four hours on NR, however some works require isolation of both the LUL and NR tracks which leaves us with only two hours,” says Atif. “We do what we can. Usually we prepare for the weekend possessions so we can have a proper go at the work over the longer period.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A hawk-like watch has to be kept on the progress of overnight or weekend work, as handing track back late incurs major financial penalties. "Since the job started three years ago, we’ve never overrun on one of our possessions,” he says.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Both NR and LUL need precise information on what work is being done, and how – down to details of what plant is required and how it will access and exit the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Before any works are carried out on or near the line on NR, a Safe System of Work (SSOW) plan needs to be produced.  This is a document to inform the Controller of Site Safety the location of the works, access/egress points, isolation details, whether there are trains running, line speed and direction and any other hazards associated with the site of work. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One plan is required for each work group. To give an idea of the number of documents that are produced, over the Easter Possession Amer Inayat, Costain’s only SSOW Planner, produced over 100 of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To ensure possessions run smoothly, Atif attends two ‘red, amber, green’ (RAG) meetings each week where clients and contractors go through possessions planned for the following 14 weeks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This information is updated regularly on the ‘RAG sheet’ that is distributed through the project team and Atif talks to team members daily. They are also circulated with details of which possessions have been approved…or declined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’ve never been turned down by LUL as such,” says Atif, “but possessions have been refused for external reasons. For example, LUL wanted to keep services running for the royal wedding during the holiday Friday and NR shortened their possession to cope with the London Marathon.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">14 June 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The UK water industry faces many challenges in the years ahead but Costain is well placed to help meet those challenges, says Costain’s Water Sector Director, Graham Keegan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Government and industry regulator are tasked with cutting wastage and preserving what is becoming an increasingly valuable resource, while at the same time protecting consumers from paying higher bills.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Add to the mix tighter regulation around water usage and increasingly stringent legislation on carbon emissions and energy efficiency, then there’s no shortage of issues facing the water industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Over the next 10 years we will see more of a focus on energy efficiency, resilience issues around climate change and regulation, regulation change and increased competition driven by OFWAT and DEFRA, and of course increased efficiency demands and customer satisfaction,” said Keegan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s strategy for the Water Sector involves building on its market leading position as a company that can deliver capital projects and, given the need for the Water companies to find greater cost efficiencies, continue to provide its customers with innovative solutions, said Keegan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"The challenges facing the water industry over the next 10 years means companies are going to have to be more adaptable and smarter at meeting the needs of their customers,” Keegan said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An example of this could be assisting water companies, which have large and disparate estates, with the introduction of renewable energy using photovoltaic panels, hydro electric devices or wind turbines, said Keegan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The UK Government has a legally binding target to ensure that 15% of the UK’s energy demand comes from renewable resources by 2020.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Opportunities will also arise from water companies looking for greater efficiencies in repair and maintenance projects. As OFWAT demands greater efficiency, water companies will be forced to reassess the methods they employ to deliver their capex programmes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s reputation in the Water Sector was recently bolstered with the announcement of two contract extensions, one with United Utilities and the other for Severn Trent, under the Asset Management Programme 5 (AMP5).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For United Utilities, Costain will, as part of the Costain, Galliford Try and Atkins joint venture, undertake over £200million worth of work to upgrade and extend Sandon Dock sewage treatment works in Liverpool.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of Severn Trent, Costain will work with Severn Trent and other non-infrastructure contractors, to undertake a programme of major schemes to a value of £187million. The work will include a number of design and build wastewater schemes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While competition in the sector remains fierce, Costain has a strong track record of working with the 10 major water companies in England and Wales, ever since AMP2 in 1995.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The overall capex spend in AMP5 in England and Wales is expected to be £22.1billion, with a slightly lower figure allocated to operational expenditure spending. Early predictions for AMP6, which begins in 2015, indicate no reduction in these levels of investment.<br /> <br />"Opportunities will be considerable for contractors who can adapt and embrace innovation to drive efficiency savings across the full spectrum of service offering, from front line maintenance activities to full scale capital projects,” said Keegan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Gradually, the nature of the work is going to change, with a greater emphasis on capital maintenance over capital enhancements, and we’re already seeing that happen,” Keegan said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the short-term, Keegan says the Government’s White Paper, due to be published by the end of 2011 before being passed into law in 2012, will set out the Government’s plans for the water industry and address the challenges facing the industry including future resource needs, charging and affordability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"The White Paper will only cover England but will determine how the water companies act in securing water sources in the future, respond to increasing competition, drive innovation and incentivise water conservation,” said Keegan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"It’s certainly an exciting time to be working in the Water industry and we feel Costain is very well placed to help address the challenges in the years ahead,” said Keegan.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">8 June 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain Group has achieved Platinum in Business in the Community`s (BITC) 2011 Corporate Responsibility Index (CRI), the UK`s leading voluntary benchmark of corporate responsibility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The CRI helps companies to integrate and improve corporate responsibility throughout their business operations, by providing a systematic approach to managing, measuring and reporting on business impacts in society and on the environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Achieving Platinum means that Costain has integrated corporate responsibility (CR) into its business model and has clear CR responsibilities and incentive structures at board and operational levels. Platinum companies have a structured approach to data collection and social and environmental impact assessment.  They can demonstrate 3-4 years of performance improvement across their key impacts. They act and report with a high level of transparency and stakeholder engagement, and the materiality, completeness and responsiveness of their published data is often third party assured.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"We are delighted to achieve Platinum in BITC's Corporate Responsibility Index for the first time. The index provides vital third party assessment of our performance and includes many of our key customers such as National Grid, Network Rail, Severn Trent and United Utilities. Effective management of all of our stakeholder relationships goes to the very heart of how we do business at Costain." Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive, Costain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stephen Howard, Chief Executive, Business in the Community said: “I congratulate Costain on achieving Platinum in the 2011 BITC Corporate Responsibility Index. It is a challenging time, but the results of this year’s Index demonstrate that companies are still focused on transforming their businesses in order to have a positive impact on society. All the companies who participated this year are at different stages in their responsible business journey, but they are all taking these issues seriously and are prepared to lead by example.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The full results of the 2011 CRI, including commentary and analysis, are published in the Financial Times Responsible Business supplement today, 8 June.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">7 June 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has completed an Urgent Care Centre, incorporating an Emergency Department, at Weston General Hospital, in North Somerset, more than six weeks ahead of schedule - enabling the hospital to treat patients at the new facility earlier than expected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The facility, which opened to the public on April 13, combines the expertise of a hospital Emergency Department with GPs who specialise in urgent care. Patients arriving at the department are assessed as to whether they need emergency care or have life-threatening conditions, and are then directed to the most appropriate area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This new way of working has been developed by hospital and GP staff to make sure that patients’ needs are dealt with more quickly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Emergency Department treated 50,000 people last year and this is expected to rise by 10 per cent per year. This is the fourth project completed for Weston Area Health NHS Trust under the Pro Cure 21 scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project totalled 1600 metres squared, with 800 m<sup>2</sup> of new build and 800 m<sup>2</sup> of refurbishment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We had to build a temporary emergency department in eight weeks and move the staff into it prior to taking possession of the site. We’re proud to have completed the works in the middle of a live hospital six weeks early, with no accidents and within budget,” said Paul Smith, the Project Manager on the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Paul attributed the success of the project to good daily coordination with the client and a rigorous adherence to the construction programme, as well as a good performance from the supply chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“As a live site we were completely surrounded on all sides and above by other departments that continued working 24-hours a day. We minimised any disruption, particularly around noise and dust, so all the life-critical services could continue,” Paul said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new Urgent Care Centre is the final project in a series by Costain at Weston General Hospital, which included the refurbishment of an emergency admissions unit, a single-sex ward, the refurbishment of Hutton Ward and a new Magnetic  Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner facility and extension to the existing X-ray department.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new X-ray department, also at Weston General Hospital, allows radiographers to perform scans throughout the week.  Prior to the extension, the Trust depended on weekly visits from a mobile service. The building also has an ultra-sound room, stretcher bays and a sub-waiting room for out patients. Patients previously had to wait in corridor facilities and the new room now offers better privacy and dignity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the completion of the Urgent Care Centre project, Weston Area Health NHS Trust Chief Executive, Lorene Read, said: “We are very proud to have opened our new Urgent Care Centre, which was completed on time and on budget.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It is a state-of-the-art facility offering patients far greater privacy and dignity than our previous, more cramped Emergency Department could do. It was a very exciting project for the Trust and one which we believe has transformed our patients’ experience of accessing urgent care here for the better.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">6 June 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The search for excellence has led to a valuable Severn Trent workshop.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Finding ways to get the most out of any working relationship isn’t an easy process but the benefits to the team and to the customer are crucial to its success and sustainability, says Maria Melton, Delivery Manager on the Costain MWH framework team, for Severn Trent Water (STW).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team from Costain, MWH and Severn Trent got together on May 24, in Solihull, to participate in a one-day workshop called Creating the Perfect Design and Construct (D&amp;C) Team, to see how they could get the best out of their working relationship and further improve their performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The team is now in the second year of a five-year framework agreement with Severn Trent and, with the team having grown considerably since its inception in April 2010, it was felt that it was timely to review their performance and to examine ways of further strengthening the relationships across the client, design and construction spectrum.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s very important that we, as a team, spend time reviewing our performance because the conversations in the workshop will aid the team’s development and help build stronger and more aligned relationships to take us into years 2, 3, 4 and 5, and ultimately into AMP6 and beyond,” said Maria.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using a formula that was originally developed by the 4D Costain MWH, the workshop was opened by Matt Crabtree, Costain’s Customer Director, and Richard Ratcliff, MWH’s Water Business Director.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Splitting into three mixed teams, the workshop consisted of three key areas for discussion followed by an opportunity to deliver feedback and to discuss their findings. The topics covered included:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• What is perfect D&amp;C? What are the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Are we working as effectively as we should and what can be improved?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• An environment of competition and cooperation creates high performing teams</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Following the workshop, an eight-point action plan was developed focusing on leaner delivery through improving the organisational setup, the working environment, systems and processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ian Moore, the STW Area Manager who attended the workshop, said it is important to continually challenge the team, as well as the supply chain, to drive efficiencies and to get the best out of the relationship.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s important to have an action plan with assigned owners, as well as a set of tangible metrics so that improvements can be demonstrated,” Ian said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Richard Ratcliff of MWH added that for the team to develop, it’s important not to rely too much on what had been achieved in the past but to focus on what can be achieved, as a group, in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Continued improvement in performance will be achieved through maturing relationships and building on the single Delivery Team identity,” said Richard.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the workshop, Costain’s Matt Crabtree, said: “Working relationships change over time and therefore holding a team workshop is a great way of bringing all the teams together and getting everyone involved in reviewing our performance and examining ways we can improve as a team.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">3 June 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The completion of the UK’s largest current nuclear project, Evaporator D (where Costain is working with Sellafield Ltd), has moved a stage nearer with the successful completion of the first of the module delivery stages required for this impressive project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first two of the planned eleven modules required for the facility were successfully transported via Self Propelled Modular Transporters (SPMT) 1.5 kilometres from the Interserve Pioneer Point facility, Cheshire to the specialist barge the Terra Marique, moored at Manchester ship canal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The modules, which consist of structural steel, stainless steel pipework, vessels and other equipment, weighing in at over 100 Te, measure 10m high, 7.5m wide and almost 10m in length, made an imposing sight as they were loaded onto the barge prior to sailing the 90 miles north to a beach adjacent to the Sellafield site on the West Cumbrian Coast. Utilising sea transport for the first time in the history of the Sellafield site, the modules were conveyed to the Sellafield beach, off loaded from the barge and driven across a purpose built bridge across the River Ehen, which runs parallel to the site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The final stage of the module delivery project involved the Self Propelled Modular Transporters moving the modules onto the Sellafield site to be placed in a purpose built storage area awaiting installation in the Evaporator D building later this year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work on the Evaporator D project is due to be completed in 2014. It will provide additional capacity to support the site’s existing evaporators, which continue to play a pivotal role in the delivery of nuclear fuel reprocessing contracts and in maximising the reduction of risk to the public and the environment from site operations.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">2 June 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is collaborating with Cambridge University on a new type of sensor that could see the Company earning royalties if the device proves successful in the marketplace.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Geotechnical Services Division (GSD) is expanding its services to include state-of-the-art surveying instrumentation and the sensor, known as a ‘mote’, is an example of the type of service it increasingly plans to offer clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The mote measures inclination, or movement, in structures and detects any widening of cracks. Such sensors already exist, but the selling point of the mote is that several can be linked together in a ‘mesh wireless’ network. This means that they can communicate via each other and then to a gateway that transmits data to a monitoring station via 3G modem.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Should a problem arise with the wireless link between two sensors, they will create a new wireless pathway that avoids the problem area.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other advantages of the sensors include high resolution – they can measure changes in inclination to 0.01°  –  very low power consumption that means their batteries last around a year and their ability to be installed very quickly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The devices are the result of research by Cambridge University’s engineering department, a member of which set up a company called Wisen to exploit the invention. Costain’s Technical Director, Bill Hewlett, who has links with the University, came across the mote and realised it could be of use to the Group.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We have a trial installation using four motes at one of the shafts in the Brighton and Hove project to bring cleaner seas to Sussex ,” said Senior Survey Manager, Nigel Drayton.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A group of 13 motes and two gateways is also operational at the Crossrail tunnel portal project at Pudding Mill Lane, East London, measuring any movement in two axes on a retaining wall.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is also in the early stages of a project with Cambridge University to develop a mote using an infra-red laser to measure convergence in tunnels and shafts. This would be utilised on the National Grid London Power Tunnels project to monitor existing tunnels during tunnelling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Through their use at Brighton and Hove we’ve developed a second-generation mote that’s smaller and more robust,” added Nigel. “We’re now negotiating with Wisen and are planning to develop it further.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If an agreement is successfully struck between Costain GSD and Wisen for GSD to become agents for Wisen in Europe, GSD would then be in a position to install motes for in-house contracts or third-party monitoring schemes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, the scope of works Costain would seek to cover if an agreement is secured would be in line with the Choosing Costain strategy and cover initial consultancy, installation and a maintenance service agreement. </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">1 June 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain was recognised at the Considerate Constructors Scheme 2011 National Site Awards in April, by winning 16 awards including Most Considerate Site 2011 Runner Up in the Gold Award category for the Bell Common Tunnel Refurbishment Works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The awards recognise outstanding consideration towards work force, neighbours and the environment, with the sites chosen from approximately 8,500 eligible projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The awards are only given to the highest scoring 7.5 per cent of sites in the scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Accepting the award at a ceremony at the Plaisterers’ Hall in London for the Bell Common Refurbishment Works, Andy Firth, the Project Manager, said working on other projects gave his team invaluable experience in understanding what the Scheme were looking for.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are delighted to receive the award, which reflected the efforts of the entire team and our commitment to our workforce and the wider community. It also showed the continuous improvement of the team who worked on the M25 Homesdale and M27 projects,” said Andy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As well as winning the Runner Up award for Bell Common, the Highways sector won three other awards, including two Bronzes for the Church Village Bypass for Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council and the A34 Wolvercote Viaduct Replacement, and one Silver for the M1 J10-13 Improvement Scheme with joint venture partner Carillion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the Water Sector, the 4D Delivery Ltd team, a Costain joint venture with Veolia Water Technologies and Solutions and MWH, won five awards, including two for the Cleaner seas for Sussex scheme, and one each for the Eastney Pumping Station, Ashford Growth and Twyford Water Supply works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also in the Water Sector, the Stream Three joint venture, which comprises Costain and Veolia Water Technologies and Solutions, won Bronze for the Mersey Valley Processing Centre at Shell Green for United Utilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the Waste Sector, the Riverside Resource Recovery Facility at Belvedere in Kent won Bronze and Silver for their work, and the Bredbury site team won Silver for their work at the Greater Manchester Recycling and Waste Contract at Bredbury Parkway for Viridor Laing (Greater Manchester) Ltd.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Education Sector won two Silver awards for their work on two schools for Integrated Bradford Ltd, the Grange Technology College and the Greenhead &amp; Beechcliffe School.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A range of factors are taken into consideration before an award is given, including how the site is managed by the company and contractors, how clean, safe and environmentally responsible it is, whether it is respectful and considerate to its neighbours and how responsible and accountable it is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Any registered site is eligible to win an award providing the site, or registered phase of it, has been completed. An independent panel reviews all eligible sites and decides whether a site has reached the standard required.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Approximately 3,000 guests attended a total of 11 lunch ceremonies held in Edinburgh, Manchester and London, where the awards were presented.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">31 May 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has helped to deliver £15million worth of cost savings for a major road project in Port Talbot through managing innovative client specific solutions and Value Engineering, which ensured the project went ahead and continued to receive funding from the Welsh Assembly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) phase of the Port Talbot Peripheral Distributor Road (PDR) Stage 2 project, between April 2009 and October 2010, led to £15million of savings against the original tender.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This was delivered through having a dedicated team from Costain and the client, Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council, reviewing the scheme’s objectives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Value Engineering involves developing the same or better product while using fewer resources. Some of the solutions included changing the carriageway foundations from piling to reinforced earth together with surcharge and settlement periods, and amending road layouts to reduce carriageway areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Working with the client, we used a three-stage Value Engineering process which focused our efforts on ideas that were more likely to deliver value without compromising on quality,” said Charlie Sleep, Planner for the scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sleep said potential savings were initially brainstormed at a Project Team workshop. The second stage was to develop the ideas and come up with a budget cost and saving for each one within two weeks of the workshop. The third stage was to develop the selected ideas and outline the design before seeking stakeholder approval.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The three-stage approach ensured that the amount of effort expended on an idea was proportional to the likely savings it would yield, and also that the appropriate level of stakeholder buy-in was achieved at each stage,” said Sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Throughout the process, we maintained a running total of the potential and achieved savings. This allowed us to determine which ideas were worth pursuing further at each stage of the process, whilst keeping a focus on the target savings required,” Sleep said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new proposals required the submission of a new planning application for the route in October 2010.  The actual construction budget for the scheme was £84 million but this was eventually brought down to £69 million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’re delighted with the results which represent an excellent example of working together to find client-specific solutions,” said Rhys Griffith, Project Manager for Port Talbot PDR scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Value Engineering delivered project savings which made the scheme affordable and ensured that Transport Grant funding was provided by the Welsh Assembly,” said Griffith.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The savings also delivered improved economical cost benefit assessment results for the scheme, which helped inform the award of a European Convergence grant of £59million for the scheme. This is believed to be the largest European grant to Wales for a Highways scheme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Port Talbot PDR will be an important catalyst for the regeneration and economic development of the industrial area of Port Talbot by providing direct access to the M4 Motorway and dock area. The three-mile link road will also remove local traffic from the M4 and reduce congestion in a restricted corridor.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting, John Skentelbery, Project Manager on the Port Talbot PDR project, said: “The need to Value Engineer the project was extremely important in enabling the project to go ahead to the construction phase. The pre-construction Value Engineering involved all parties, including Neath Port Talbot CBC, Costain, our supply chain partners and key third parties, and this will continue through the construction phase. The exercise has resulted in a stronger “one team” approach focused on delivering a successful project.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">27 May 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Costain-Carillion JV team on the £266million M1 J10-13 Hard Shoulder Running (HSR) scheme has achieved a project milestone by erecting the first of 56 new ‘Superspan’ motorway gantries being installed over the next 18 months.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A rolling roadblock was used instead of a full carriageway closure and the installation was completed within 30 minutes. The gantries will carry the signage and technology essential to allow the hard shoulder on the 24km of carriageway to operate as a traffic lane during busier periods, in line with the Highways Agency Managed Motorways programme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work on site is progressing well, with the scheme due to be fully completed in Spring 2013.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">25 May 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, one of the UK's leading construction and engineering solutions providers, is pleased to announce that it has been instructed to undertake two major water contract extensions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Firstly, Costain, as part of the Costain, Galliford Try and Atkins joint venture, has been instructed to undertake £200million worth of work by United Utilities to upgrade and extend Sandon Dock sewage treatment works in Liverpool.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is part of the Asset Management Programme 5 (“AMP5”) with United Utilities and will be progressed through the existing process alliance framework.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The scheme involves extending the current treatment works into the adjacent dock along with major upgrade works to the existing plant all of which will improve the quality of the final effluent in line with discharge consents set by the Environment Agency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, Costain is pleased to announce a further extension to its AMP5 contract with Severn Trent Water ("Severn Trent") worth around £45million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Working in partnership with Severn Trent and other non-infrastructure contractors, a programme of major schemes to a value of £187million has been agreed and will include the provision of wastewater schemes for Costain to design and build.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the contract awards, <strong>Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive of Costain,</strong> said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“We are delighted to have secured these two contracts, which demonstrate the UK water industry’s continued investment in infrastructure, and help us build on our market leading position in the water sector.”</strong></em></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">24 May 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain’s Geotechnical Services Division* (GSD) has been successfully awarded one of five places on the National Site Investigation Framework (NSIF3) for the Environment Agency (EA).  The duration of NSIF3 is a period of 4 years commencing on 4 April 2011, with an estimated value of £5million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to the rigorous procurement process used by the EA to award this framework, this contract award has the potential to provide Costain GSD with other opportunities outside the EA, such as the Highways Agency and other Government bodies including local councils.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the award, Andy Bull, Environmental Services Director, said: “This is a fantastic result.  Securing a framework agreement direct with a blue chip client such as the Environment Agency is a great reflection of where GSD as a division has got to, and is representative of the kind of work we want to be doing in the future.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">*Costain GSD provides a one-stop facility for geotechnical and geo-environmental site investigation, in-situ materials testing and geotechnical and materials laboratory testing. Our clients include numerous engineering consultants, specialist geo-environmental consultants, infrastructure and utilities operators as well as the Costain Group. We have 60 engineers and technicians operating from the head office in Bourne End, near Maidenhead, regional offices in Manchester and Castleford and various long term site laboratories. These offices provide full coverage of all services across the UK.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">23 May 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, in line with its Costain Cares initiative, is launching a new employee engagement survey that aims to gather feedback from everyone in the Company on how it can improve as a business.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Feedback is an essential part of that process and that is why everyone from across the organisation is being asked to take part and to share their views on what matters to them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The survey is due to be rolled out on 1st June until 24th June.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People will receive a personal email invitation to complete the online survey, which contains between 60-70 questions and once the survey has been completed, Get Feedback, an independent organisation that specialises in employee engagement, will collate the results and ensures the anonymity of all those taking part. <br /> <br />The Company also intends to donate £1 to charity for every questionnaire completed, with the Employee Consultative Committee choosing which charity will be the beneficiary.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Christina Wade, Costain’s HR Director, says the positives arising from greater engagement include better communication, feeling more involved in the business and having a stake in the Company’s future.<br /> <br />“We know that our people are the key to driving our business forward and we want to ensure we have a formal way to engage with them and to capture their ideas.  We know that businesses succeed and develop when people think creatively and innovatively about ways they can help, both themselves and their customers,” said Christina.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Charles Sweeney, Managing Director of Costain’s Energy and Process Division, agrees, adding that the survey is a natural extension of what Costain does better than anyone and that is listening to its customers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Engagement is one of the key drivers of our business. We can’t work as closely as we do with our customers in Energy and Process without high levels of engagement. As a business we need that feedback,” said Charles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The survey ties in with the launch of Costain Cares, the Company’s new operational drive to build a longer-term sustainable business, which has been designed to create greater economic, environmental and social value for its stakeholders, including its employees.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Alan Kay, Managing Director of the Environment Division, believes it’s important that everyone buys into the employee survey because it will help the overall success of the Choosing Costain strategy as well as the long-term goals of the Costain Cares initiative.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain’s greatest asset is its people. The successful delivery of the Choosing Costain strategy and Costain Cares is reliant upon buy-in by all of our employees. Open and honest feedback from the forthcoming Employee Engagement Survey is fundamental in helping us achieve this,” said Alan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The results of the survey will be used to create action plans that will be implemented either at a Group wide or local level.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Past examples of where employee feedback has made a difference includes adopting a holiday buy scheme, a share save scheme and childcare vouchers. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Darren James, Managing Director of Costain’s Infrastructure Division, says that the survey is an excellent opportunity to give feedback and make suggestions for the benefit of everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Even suggestions about making small changes count just as much as the “big” ideas. The employee survey gives everyone a voice to make relevant observations and recommendations that can be acted upon for everyone’s benefit,” said Darren.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">20 May 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The £300million environmental improvement scheme bringing cleaner seas to Sussex has now delivered several of its major milestones, through a combination of advanced project controls and inventive production techniques, which ensure the project remains on track and potential risks are reduced.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is now approaching the halfway mark, says Chief Engineer on the scheme, Clive Glasspool. The scheme involves constructing 11km of tunnels to take wastewater, via underground pumping stations, to a new wastewater treatment plant at Peacehaven. <br /> <br />“We’ve excavated and deposited over 250,000m³ of chalk at the main wastewater treatment works site, completed 25,000m³ of reinforced concrete and installed 3,000 tonnes of structural steelwork to the treatment buildings,” says Glasspool. The buildings’ green roof, designed to blend the building in with the downland landscape, is presently being installed and covers an area equivalent to almost three football pitches.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“In addition, more than 80 per cent of the tunnelling, as well as all the pumping station shafts, each 17m in diameter and a maximum depth of 45m, have now been completed.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Due to its size and complexity the project programme has been developed in a web-based environment. This arrangement, part of a 4Delivery business collaboration system, also allows for the consistent monthly reporting on each of the 18 sub-projects, with data automatically taken from the programme and its baseline. “Access is provided for the client to get the same information that we are using ourselves and a true collaborative approach is being achieved,” adds Glasspool.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A further significant step in the project has been the linking of risks to the programme and analysing their impacts using risk analysis software. This not only identifies the required time risk allowance for the project as a whole, but also for the individual sub-projects and indicates which risks have the greatest potential impact on the project, allowing the team to implement appropriate mitigation measures.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The most important step is getting the programme and risks understood and owned by those performing the tasks. To do this, we’re using ‘last planner’ collaborative techniques to bring together all parties on the project to identify constraints and opportunities, especially those in the supply chain,” explains Glasspool.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I’ve spoken to major members of our supply chain who have commented that it’s invaluable in avoiding clashes and identifying needs well ahead of time. This means that everything is in place when the supplier turns up and all the previous tasks leading up to the new operation are complete. It’s too easy to miss one item that has an impact on the efficiency of the task or unnecessarily provide something twice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Furthermore, health and safety issues can be managed out of the process when the detail is explored to this level.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It makes everything run more smoothly. On this project in particular, there are numerous complicated interfaces that become manageable with this approach. It provides an enormous amount of confidence when you start an operation knowing everything is in place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The next major milestone will be completion of the tunnels in June. This, and the recently commenced M&amp;E installation, are now the key activities that will allow us to achieve the significant milestone of bringing the wastewater from the catchment area into the works to start the commissioning process at the end of this year. When operational, the system will be able to handle a flow of more than 2,500 litres per second.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It’s been challenging, but all the challenges have been successfully met and we’re on line to achieve our takeover dates.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">17 May 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has been granted its first nuclear-related patent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The patent, which involves a more efficient method of immobilising radioactive sludge in a cement matrix, has been granted after an extensive four-year examination process from the Patent Office.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nuclear power plants store used fuel canisters in cooling water ponds to enable radiation levels to decrease before the fuel is reprocessed. The storage process leaves a radioactive sludge in the pond which can be immobilised by mixing it with cement for safe, long-term storage. The immobilisation process operates on a batch-wise basis.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain developed an improved process to enable the cementation of larger quantities of radioactive sludge more quickly and reliably than at present. The proposed process could deliver a six-fold increase in the number of drums filled per week from two to twelve.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The innovative approach was developed by process engineers Jaswinder Singh and Lee Scott, who were jointly awarded the Innovation Award at the Costain Celebrating Success event in December 2006.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain decided the technique was sufficiently innovative to apply for a patent. The application was granted after a comprehensive examination process by a Patent Office examiner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are extremely pleased to have been granted our first nuclear patent”, said Paul Campbell, Nuclear Process Sector Director. “This is one of a number of our novel approaches to the problems encountered when decommissioning nuclear plant.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“This demonstrates the importance Costain places on developing innovative solutions to address complex challenges faced by the industry,” added Charles Sweeney, Costain Energy &amp; Process Managing Director.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">16 May 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A major milestone has taken place on the UK’s largest current nuclear project with the topping out of the Evaporator D building, at Sellafield, on the northwest coast of England.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A Costain-Sellafield Ltd alliance will later this year complete the basic structure of the building, which is designed to reduce the volume of highly radioactive liquid waste at the Cumbria site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a project which, for obvious reasons, requires the highest possible standards of build quality. Just designing and developing the initial construction safety case for the £397million project took a year; work on the foundations began in May 2009 and the project is not scheduled to be fully complete until summer 2014.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When in service, it will be used to reduce the quantities of Highly Active Liquor, a product of reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel.  The liquor is reduced in quantity by a factor of 20 by evaporation, to reduce the volume of highly active waste that will be vitrified in glass and stored on site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The liquor will be evaporated inside a highly complex process plant designed by Costain Energy &amp; Process in the Manchester office. The Evaporator D process plant will add additional capacity to the current evaporators on the site and provide continuity in the reprocessing and decommissioning programme at Sellafield.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An idea of the scale of the project comes from the fact that over 350 Costain personnel – around 150 of them designers – are involved on it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We’ve been carrying out design work since 2007,” says Construction Director, Rob Phillips. “This is all about providing a solution to the customer. It’s a project where we carry out everything from front-end design, through procurement and construction to commissioning and it’s certainly the largest where we’re providing the total solution.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For example, says Phillips, Costain buys the stainless steel for the evaporator module, sends it to a mill in Sweden to be turned into sheets, then upon its return oversees it being transformed into components for the modules. “Costain Energy &amp; Process has managed it right from the material stage. That way, we can guarantee its provenance.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 11 modules – the largest of which weighs 500 tonnes – are being constructed by a supply chain partner in Ellesmere Port, in Merseyside. These outsize loads are brought to Sellafield by barge and then transported across a beach, railway line, the River Ehen and public road to the site. A temporary bridge has been constructed over the Eden using four, 38-metre steel beams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A further two beams, known as the Kursk Beams (after being originally fabricated to help raise the Russian nuclear submarine of that name that sank in 2000) are being used as part of a gantry in the Evaporator D building. This 35-metre-high gantry will be used to install the modules in the building.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The modules have to be completed to Build Level One – “The highest quality level you can get”, says Phillips. “Everything has to be 100% inspected.” Every weld, of which there are 2,000 in the evaporator module alone, needs to be radiographed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The next 18 months should see completion of the civils side of the project, together with installation of the modules and around 70% of the mechanical, engineering and instrumentation equipment installed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ends</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">11 May 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The UK’s largest energy-from-waste plant is speeding towards its conclusion as the Belvedere facility on the south bank of the Thames Estuary goes through testing and commissioning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The plant is heading for takeover by client Cory Environmental Ltd during summer 2011, partly due to Costain’s achievement in providing timely infrastructure for the process equipment installation and especially the slab for the flue gas treatment equipment early in the programme schedule.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once fully operational, the plant will take the domestic waste from four central London boroughs and other sources. The majority will be ferried downriver by barge, keeping around 100,000 truck movements off local roads each year. Local waste from Bexley is also being processed in the facility.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The waste will be thoroughly mixed before being fed into the three process trains, providing heat to create steam that will, in turn, drive a turbine that will generate 65MW of electricity from the 585,000-average tonnes of waste delivered annually.<br /> <br />The project – known as the Riverside Resource Recovery Facility (RRRF) – is worth in excess of £300million.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has been on-site since July 2008 creating the site’s buildings and structures. Its design and build contract included the major process equipment building – some 150m x 60m x 50m high – plus the 270m-long waste delivery jetty.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Challenges have included three of the harshest winters of recent times and extremely challenging client requirements and specification.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, with the bad weather now just a bad memory and the facility now standing adjacent to the River Thames, Costain is finishing off external paving, landscaping and finishing works to allow the handover on time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The most recent milestone was the first delivery of waste to the facility via the large jetty that’s been built and the commencement of processing of that waste as part of the testing and commissioning phase,” says Costain’s Project Manager, John Russell.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain was able to help speed the project by rearranging the usual order of construction. “What normally happens is that the process contractor starts at the tipping hall, where the waste arrives, and works his way across the plant to get to the flue gas treatment area. We provided the flue gas treatment slab early in the programme. This allowed the process contractor to get in to start his process equipment erection earlier than he would normally have done.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The toughest hurdles, he said, were the programme schedule – “Extremely challenging and certainly one of the fastest timescales to which one of these plants has been constructed” – together with the logistics and co-ordination of the works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the peak of activity more than 1,000 people were working on site. Additionally, there was a great deal of process equipment to fabricate, fit and install in a very small space.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When fully operational, the RRRF will make a real contribution to London’s ability to meet its landfill diversion targets, as well as creating a new source of electricity for the National Grid.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">5 May 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has launched Costain Cares, a new operational drive to build a longer-term sustainable business that creates greater economic, environmental and social value.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Cares will address further the developing needs of stakeholders and increase the speed and scale of change towards a responsible business and, at the same time, will enhance performance in every facet of Costain’s operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It will define what the Company does, from building relationships with stakeholders, to securing new orders from major customers and delivering profitable solutions through innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Cares will not only guide the business, but will enable the Company to measure performance continually through third party assessment and set strategic goals for the future.<br /> <br />The business case for operating responsibly is compelling, as are the benefits that this will bring in the form of increased shareholder value.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain Cares has come about after a period of detailed stakeholder engagement. The Company has listened to the views of customers, communities, colleagues and shareholders. This process has highlighted the issues that are paramount and where the Company must focus to enable Costain to fulfil its potential.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The companies that adhere to a greater corporate and social responsibility will be more successful, and offer greater returns to shareholders and the communities they serve.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Business in the Community (BITC), the business-led charity, has published research showing that FTSE350 companies which consistently manage and measure their corporate responsibility outperformed their FTSE 350 peers on total shareholder return (TSR).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Responsible business is not a trade off between profit, people and planet. All companies should be expanding the connections between social and economic progress and looking at innovative ways to integrate responsible business practices into their core activities. Costain Cares aims to do just that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the new initiative, Andrew Wyllie, Costain’s Chief Executive, said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“Costain Cares will establish a new level of competitiveness. It will shape the future of our business and drive actions on a day-to-day basis.”</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Catherine Warbrick, Costain’s Corporate Responsibility Director, said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>“Costain Cares is about an enhanced level of commitment to our stakeholders. We will focus on the issues they really care about, and set more ambitious performance levels against which they can hold us to account.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>"We are now raising the bar even further, as we work closely with our stakeholders to achieve our vision of being one of the UK’s leading solutions providers.”</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />Notes</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Business in the Community (BITC)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BITC advises supports and challenges its members to improve business performance and create a sustainable future for people and the planet. Its members work with them to define what responsibility looks like in the workplace, marketplace, community and the environment, and shares what it learns about driving performance through responsible business practice.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For further information, please visit BITC’s website at: <a href="http://www.bitc.org.uk/">www.bitc.org.uk/</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />What is a responsible business?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BITC uses the following framework of responsible business, to help members to integrate responsible practice into their day-to-day operations:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Demonstrating clear leadership, governance and values and integrating responsible business practices across all business operations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Developing products and services with improved social and environmental impacts, and positively influencing customer’s behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Developing employees and the future workforce to build successful working lives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Investing in communities in which the business operates and those communities in greatest need.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Manage social, environmental, and economic impacts in your supply chain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Managing resources sustainably, taking action to reduce climate change and prepare for a low carbon economy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">• Working with others in collaboration to create change that benefits both business and society.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">4 May 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has been short listed for a Construction News Award for the ‘Best Use of Technology’ in the new deployment of a computer application that saves time and money on large projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The application, called Oracle Primavera P6 Enterprise, or P6 for short, allows for more effective planning of complex projects by letting the project team share access to, and development of, the programme and then communicate the results to the whole team. The ’Enterprise’ part means that all planning is carried out in a central database, and that anyone can be given access to the programme for any project from anywhere, via the Internet. Additionally, this shared access enables direct support of users to communicate best practice methods of using P6.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"There is a growing need to be able to create an overall project programme that directly incorporates the work of all the parties involved, especially when producing an integrated design and construction programme,” said Phil Budden, the Costain engineer responsible for deploying P6.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just a few years ago, project and planning teams operated in isolation of each other. Programmes were developed on a stand-alone basis, whereby individual solutions were created for individual problems.  While this approach has served Costain well, it was difficult to manage a large-scale project with multiple planners, potentially based in various locations. It also created problems if, in a joint venture with different companies, culture and indeed applications, teams had varying ways of working and problem solving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"The ‘old’ way produced inconsistent results that took a lot of effort to manage, especially at handover on Contract award,” said Budden.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was therefore a growing need for an integrated design and construction programme that incorporated a best practice approach, as well as including input from key supply chain partners and, where the planning for the entire project can be carried out in one place, be visible to anyone in the team, from anywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An early example where the programme was used to great effect was for the Highways Agency at Junction 1 on the M25, at Dartford.  Significant time was saved when the client agreed to dramatically change the programme sequence after work had already started, which saved five months on the overall duration of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Budden said achieving this was significantly assisted through both the project team and the client sharing access to the programme, which allowed all parties to understand the proposed changes quickly enough to make a timely decision.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"What we’ve done is exploit an existing product in a new way that adds significant additional benefits to the business,” said Budden, adding that P6 is now being used as an essential tool on a large majority of the projects that Costain is currently working on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">"Combining our Enterprise Planning System and using it to support our shared best practice has enabled a step change in the way we work to deliver our construction planning and has significantly improved project delivery to our clients,” Budden said.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">3 May 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Work on the new Harbour Way Peripheral Distributor Road (PDR), in Wales, has gathered speed with the installation of a new railway signal.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Heavy machinery, 26 hours and 60 pairs of hands went into removing the old train signal behind Byass Street and installing a new one 100 yards in front.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The works, carried out by Costain and its sub contractor Centregreat Rail, took place overnight to make sure disruptions to rail services were kept to a minimum.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The signal has been moved to accommodate a new 150 yard tunnel which will be built as part of the £107million project, and will be the point where the new road crosses the railway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new road, which is part of the largest transport project in Wales since the creation of the M4 and funded by European grants and the Welsh Assembly, is due to be completed in the autumn of 2013.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">John Skentelbery, Project Manager for Costain, said: "Months of preparation and close liaison with Network Rail has resulted in the safe and successful completion of this significant milestone in the Harbour Way Project."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rhys Griffith, Project Manager for Neath Port Talbot Council, said: "The signal move was the culmination of months of planning and co-operation by several stakeholders involved in the project."</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">28 April 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Water supplies for hundreds of thousands of residents in Gloucestershire are now more secure following the completion of flood defences at Mythe water treatment works (WTW).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2007, an unprecedented inundation flooded the Mythe works in Tewkesbury, leaving some 350,000 people in the region without clean water supplies for 17 days.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Severn Trent Water called in Costain to try to ensure similar problems did not recur in an era when climate change is predicted to create more violent and unpredictable weather patterns.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A £5.5million programme saw a variety of measures put in place to protect the plant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We looked at the existing structure and at the most appropriate solutions for different areas,” said Costain’s Customer Director for Water, Matt Crabtree. “Those included earth embankments, sheet piling and dwarf walls. The works provide protection in excess of a 1-in-200-year flooding event.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The work involved removing temporary flood defences installed in 2007 as well as putting the new works in place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Project Manager, Chris Vice, commented: “Technically it was pretty straightforward. The largest challenge was interfacing with the existing works and dealing with environmental aspects. We carried out noise and vibration monitoring of the works and on the adjacent Thomas Telford Bridge.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Some sheet piling was right up against the River Severn, so we had to avoid creating any pollution and be careful of the river bank structure itself.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The sheet piles were timber clad to make the works more aesthetically pleasing and will mellow into the background better as it ages. An existing public right of way that runs alongside the sheet piling was also improved as part of the works.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The project completed at the end of March, on-schedule, within budget and completely accident-free.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The client is very happy,” said Crabtree, “particularly about the work we’ve done consulting with the local population.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">20 April 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Business leaders from the water, power and construction industry were given an insight into what is being done to promote science, technology and engineering skills at a Business in the Community (BITC) event, led by Costain, for the Prince of Wales’ Seeing is Believing programme.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hosted by Andrew Wyllie, Costain’s Chief Executive, and Stephen Wells, Group Strategy and Business Development Director, with David Allvey, Costain's Chairman, one of the speakers, delegates were invited to visit Crest Boys Academy, in Neasden, and St Joseph’s RC Primary School, in Willesden, to see how programmes such as STEMNET and Mosaic, are being implemented in order to bridge the growing skills gap in the UK.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to data from BITC, the UK is at least 15% less productive than France, Germany and the US because the working age population is less skilled. The UK is also considered to be weak in vital intermediate technical skills that are increasingly important as technological change accelerates. With 80% of the people who will be in the workforce in 2020 already out of compulsory education, the scale of the task facing the UK economy is a daunting one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">STEMNET aims to redress the balance by getting more school children interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics through creativity and problem solving. It also complements initiatives that are already being undertaken in many schools across the country, such as the Mosaic mentoring programme. This initiative from The Prince of Wales aims to raise young people’s aspirations in the most deprived areas, by providing access to opportunities for education and employment otherwise not available to them, as well as broadening their horizons, providing positive role models and opening networks to access employment and education.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Andrew and Stephen were joined by seven business leaders including Martin Baggs, the Chief Executive of Thames Water; Michael Dyke, the UK Head of Construction for National Grid; Bill Hockings, Executive Vice President for Skanska UK; Andrew Flower, the Transformation Director at Serco Civil Government and Nick Maggs, Director of Energy Management Services at Enterprise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Delegates were invited to meet staff and pupils at the schools and to join in the maths and science classes so they could see for themselves how the STEMNET programme is being implemented.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The event then moved on to the National Grid Tunnelling Project, in Willesden, for an overview of the project and a question and answer session with Jeremy Galpin, Costain’s Training and Talent Manager, and Dr. John Connaughton from the Construction Youth Trust, for an insight into what Costain is doing to help bridge the skills gap.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Delegates then split into groups to meet apprentices, trainee engineers, construction ambassadors and graduates to get an insight into the challenges facing young people looking to forge a career in a technical industry and the importance of apprenticeships.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">BITC is a business-led charity and its Prince’s Seeing is Believing programme aims to inspire and engage business leaders on responsibility issues. Through unique visits into the heart of UK communities, the programme offers a way to challenge business leaders’ perceptions on responsibility issues within their individual businesses, through their supply chains and across industries.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since 1990, over 7,500 business leaders have participated in the Prince’s Seeing is Believing visits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the event, Catherine Warbrick, Corporate Responsibility Director, said: “I would like to thank everyone for making the day such a great success. As the statistics from BITC show, more needs to be done to get young people interested in science, technology and engineering if we are to face up to the significant challenges facing the UK economy in the years ahead.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">18 April 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has come top in the Highways Agency’s new supplier assessment process, which scores the services of its key highway suppliers, and was commended for how well it matched the Agency’s strategic direction in its role as network operator on England’s motorways and major trunk roads.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain came top with a score of 139.7 out of a theoretical maximum of 180, beating 20 other companies to the top spot.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Costain can be very pleased with its performance, as evidenced through its recent StART Assessment,” said David O’Neil, the Highways Agency’s head of supply chain management.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The performance is a positive indication on how well engaged and aligned the Company is around the key drivers identified in the HA Strategic Plan and Procurement Strategy. The Agency looks forward to seeing Costain continuing to demonstrate, and indeed develop further, this level of performance through delivery of its current contracts and in responding to future challenges as a Key Supplier to the Highways Agency,” O’Neil said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Strategic Alignment Review Toolkit, or StART, was developed in partnership with representatives of the construction and maintenance industry and will be used alongside past performance in short listing applicants for Asset Support Contracts and Major Projects schemes, said O’Neil.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">O’Neil said the examination of suppliers was moved from a broader assessment of supplier capability, as the previous Capability Assessment Toolkit (CAT) had done, to a focused assessment in a few critical areas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The assessments reviewed how well the Agency’s suppliers, which included the biggest names in highways maintenance in the UK, were aligned in each of five key areas – Leadership, Supply Chain, Cost, Inclusion and Sustainability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Highways Agency said Costain demonstrated an ability to engage effectively with the Highways Agency, Department of Transport, Infrastructure UK and its peers, in order to support and influence the development of the industry.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain was also commended for its strong leadership which the Agency said enabled the “effective translation of ideas into action” with a “strong focus on innovation, being responsive to customer’s needs and talent development,” as well as an ability to shape the national agenda.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the result, Tim Bowen, Costain’s Highways Director, said: “We are delighted to have been recognised as a key supplier by the Highways Agency. We work very closely with our customers in order to reach the best outcome, and I think our inclusiveness in how we work was probably the biggest differentiator here.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">12 April 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The construction of a new Combined Heat &amp; Power (CHP) unit for Severn Trent, at the Netheridge Sewage and Treatment Works in Gloucester, has reached a major milestone after it passed crucial safety checks from Central Networks.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain MWH, Severn Trent's Asset Creation and Renewable Energy team, together with the Services Delivery team, completed the construction and commissioning of the new 835KW CHP on March 14 and the plant will now be accredited with OFGEM, the gas and electricity industry regulator, with an effective handover date of May 5.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new CHP unit will generate electricity for use at the sewage works site. Any surplus electricity will be exported into the national grid and used to offset electricity imports by Severn Trent Water elsewhere.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Richard Price, the Delivery Manager for the project, said it was important the milestone was achieved as the renewable energy incentive scheme 'Renewable Obligation Certificate' (ROC) was changed on 1 April 2011. The value of sewage gas derived electricity has now been reduced and this would have greatly affected the viability of this spend to save the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Construction work began in October 2010 and it wasn't long before severe cold weather threatened to hinder progress of the project.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“It was a major achievement to get it finished ahead of schedule as the project was only conceived in June 2010 and only signed off in October. The historically cold weather in December threatened to hinder our progress because it’s difficult to pour concrete in freezing temperatures, but everyone strived to get it finished and the whole site team worked very well to coordinate the civil, mechanical and electrical aspects that made up the whole scheme.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ian Moore, Severn Trent’s Waste Water Asset Creation Manager, said: “We are delighted with the performance of the team. Everyone worked extremely well together to deliver the project ahead of schedule and to secure the required business benefits for Severn Trent Water.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">7 April 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain, the international engineering and construction group, announces that it has today acquired 75% of the share capital of ClerkMaxwell, an Aberdeen-based front-end engineering and operations support services provider operating in the upstream oil &amp; gas sector. In addition, the Group has simultaneously entered into a call option, which will provide Costain with the ability to acquire the remaining 25% of the share capital exercisable between 26 April and 31 May 2011.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Initial consideration, including the exercise cost of the call option (if exercised), will be £3.2 million for 100% of ClerkMaxwell's share capital. Deferred cash consideration payments, based on a percentage of the notional future value of ClerkMaxwell calculated on the basis of an 8.0x multiple of EBITDA ("Notional Future Value"), may also be payable shortly after completion of the financial years ending 31 December 2012, 2013 and 2014. The total percentage of Notional Future Value payable over the three years ending 31 December 2014 is 49%.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For the year ended 31 December 2010, ClerkMaxwell reported EBITDA and profit before tax of £0.4 million and £0.3 million, respectively, on revenues of £4.0 million. At 31 December 2010, ClerkMaxwell had gross assets of £1.1 million and is being acquired on a debt and cash free basis. The majority of ClerkMaxwell is being acquired from its senior management team and a private individual investor. The call option to acquire the remaining stake is between Costain and Meteor Investments.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">ClerkMaxwell, all of whose senior management team* and workforce of 50 people will remain with the business, will be integrated into the Group's Energy &amp; Process division providing Costain with a full hydrocarbons value chain capability from upstream oil &amp; gas, gas processing, LNG, gas storage through to downstream. The transaction also provides both companies with access to a larger and broader customer base.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Commenting on the acquisition, Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive of Costain, said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>"We are delighted to have acquired ClerkMaxwell. It is absolutely in-line with our strategy of broadening our existing front-end consultancy, project delivery and operations and maintenance offering through a combination of organic development and acquisitions.

<p style="text-align: justify;">John Wilson, Managing Director of ClerkMaxwell, said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>"Costain is the perfect home for ClerkMaxwell. We will bring additional skills and reach to an already strong oil and gas capability and Costain's established customer base will provide a major opportunity for us to realise our ambition of becoming a market-leading provider of value adding, front end engineering services."</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>5 April 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is giving a helping hand to ex-offenders who want to get back into mainstream society.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The move comes as London’s mayor, Boris Johnson, urges companies to take on young people – especially offenders – when carrying out major projects in the capital.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Launching the programme, Johnson said: “I’m asking the construction sector to get on board and offer our young people real opportunities on the abundance of exciting construction contracts we have in the capital.” He made the point that there were good economic, as well as social, reasons, for taking on those who have had a brush with the law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Ex-offenders deserve a second chance to turn their lives around and make an honest living,” he said.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“In these tough economic times it’s hard for everyone out of work, but teenagers with criminal records often hit a brick wall. For every person we keep out of prison we potentially save taxpayers £50,000 a year. I commend the companies already making great progress and encourage all firms to help us cut crime and offer work to ex-offenders.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A plethora of major projects are underway both in the run-up to the 2012 Olympics and beyond, such as Crossrail, the Thames Ring Main sewerage system and improvements on the Tube network.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain is playing its part with the first of what are intended to be several places offered to young ex-offenders, said Corporate Responsibility Manager, Catherine Warbrick. Shingai Musonza has just started work on the Crossrail tunnel portal project at Royal Oak, just outside Paddington.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">He got the job after completing the ‘Get Into Construction’ (GIC) course organised by the mayor and charity The Prince’s Trust.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Musonza said he’d liked the idea of working in construction for some time, but hadn’t known how to go about it. GIC had given him the necessary basic skills – in areas such as safety, manual handling and several other aspects of construction – to turn those wishes into reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I was really happy when I found out I got the job. It’s really suited to my skills and I love being outdoors doing something hands-on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I believe that everyone can change, no matter what their background. I’m so grateful to have been given a second chance.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Adds Warbrick: “With this initiative, we’ve got this one person at the moment, but we’ve committed to offer opportunities to six young ex-offenders over the next six months as a pilot scheme and we’re looking at widening that.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>4 April 2011</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Costain has picked up yet more awards, for the environmental performance of two of its projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The accolades, for the Wolvercote Viaduct replacement project in Oxfordshire and Castleford Footbridge in Yorkshire, came from CEEQUAL, a body originally created by the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE), with financial support from the UK Government and the ICE's Research &amp; Development Enabling Fund.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Its objective is to encourage the attainment of environmental and social excellence in civil engineering and public sector works and to deliver improved environmental and sustainability performance in civil engineering specification, design and construction.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">CEEQUAL looks at environmental aspects of a project including the use of water, energy and carbon, ecology, noise and dust, waste minimisation and management, and social issues such as the effects on neighbours and community relations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Awards are made to projects where the clients, designers and/or constructors have gone beyond the legal and environmental minima in the environmental field.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wolvercote was awarded an ‘Excellent’ construction-only award, while Castleford,  which has already picked up a clutch of other awards including an ‘Excellent’ whole-project CEEQUAL award, went one better by winning its category for ‘Outstanding Achievement’ in community relations.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Wolvercote project team was praised for its efforts in environmental care while replacing the 45-year-old, 250-metre-long viaduct that spanned the A40 road, the Oxford Canal and the London-Birmingham main line railway.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Among aspects that caught the CEEQUAL assessors’ eyes were the temporary translocation of an ancient hedgerow from beside the canal bridleway and its eventual replanting in its original location and the recycling of 95% – 57,000 tons – of site waste generated. The site’s community relations efforts also came in for praise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The 130-metre, S-shaped Castleford Footbridge featured particularly high standards of architecture and materials and was awarded points from the assessors for its sustainability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An extensive programme of community involvement included numerous school visits to give safety talks, as well as inviting several hundred pupils to the site. Unusually, local community representatives were involved in commenting on proposed materials and visited off-site fabricators as well as the site itself. This helped ensure universal acclaim by local residents when it was erected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The Outstanding Achievement awards event marked the first time that CEEQUAL has chosen to highlight any specific aspect of projects which have gone through the CEEQUAL assessment process,” notes Costain Environment Manager, Amy Baldry, “and the award for Castleford Footbridge commending the excellent management of the community and stakeholders is a great achievement for all those involved.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>30 March 2011</p>
<p>One of the best methods of eliminating potential safety hazards is to design them out from the very inception of a project.</p>
<p>With that in mind, ‘safety in design’ is one of Costain’s major SHE targets this year. And one way of helping deliver that is the special course developed by the Company and being run at the Construction Industry College, at Bircham Newton, in Norfolk.</p>
<p>The five-day temporary works design course was shared with permanent works designers to give them the opportunity to learn about temporary works and construction method design, a subject not usually part of their training, explains Costain Group Technical Director, Bill Hewlett.</p>
<p>To help increase the scope of the course, engineers from Costain’s partnered design consultancies – Arup, Büro Happold, Atkins and MWH joined their counterparts from within the Company for the event.</p>
<p>Designers of permanent and temporary works tend to go about their jobs in different ways. Permanent works are sometimes ‘wished into place’ and there is a need for better communication and early contractor engagement to ensure safety, health and environmental risks are mitigated; it is important also that everyone on site understands how the residual risks will be managed to ensure safety, says Hewlett.</p>
<p>“How do you get the right things in the right place at the right time? You have to design that process. You have to be thinking about the process of how something is built.”</p>
<p>Involving the external design consultancies reflects current thinking in supply chain management, where the trend is to have fewer, but closer relationships with suppliers: “We’re trying to develop that kind of relationship with our design consultants,” explains Hewlett. He believes it is the first time external consultants and their Costain counterparts have got together for this type of training exercise.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>30 March 2011</p>
<p>The latest stage in Costain’s revitalisation of education provision in Lewisham, south London, has arrived with the start of work on Addey and Stanhope School.</p>
<p>The school has roots in Deptford dating back to 1604 and is now a specialist technology school. The buildings range from the Victorian era to the 1980s and the renewal project will see a split between rebuilding and refurbishment under a Private Finance Initiative agreement.</p>
<p>As part of the Building Schools for the Future initiative, the Costain team is demolishing and replacing one of the Victorian buildings and providing a new sports hall and administrative area. The main classroom block will be updated and equipped to meet the needs of the 21st century.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to keep the business continuity going, so we will provide temporary accommodation, with pupils moving in and out in phases as we move around the school," says Commercial Manager, Ian Dixon. Costain has installed portable accommodation on a playground that will eventually be transformed into a new outdoor sports area.</p>
<p>Work on the two/three-storey building got underway in February and is expected to end in August 2012.</p>
<p>“Working in a live environment, we have to be mindful of noise levels as we work,” says Dixon. “The site’s logistics are also fairly tight and we’re right on the main New Cross Road.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>24 March 2011</p>
<p>Work on minimising the amount of waste generated on the project to bring cleaner seas to Sussex, has been so successful that it has attracted Government attention.</p>
<p>Lord Henley, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, will visit the project on 31 March to learn how 98% of the waste created has been diverted from landfill sites. A particular aim has been to find disposal options for the chalk that is being excavated during the project.</p>
<p>Southern Water’s £300 million environmental improvement scheme being delivered by 4Delivery (4D), the joint venture that combines Costain with Veolia Water and MWH, is designed to bring cleaner seas to Sussex by next year.</p>
<p>A combination of 11km of new sewer tunnel, three new pumping stations and a new wastewater treatment works at Peacehaven, east of Brighton, will see the wastewater fully treated and then dispersed at sea through a new 2.5km long sea outfall.</p>
<p>4D suggested to Pathway to Zero Waste, a Government entity with links to the Environment Agency, that a visit could be organised to a construction site where the ‘zero waste to landfill’ ethos was being successfully put into practice.  Lord Henley’s planned trip was the result.</p>
<p>According to Rachel Jackson, 4D’s Environmental Advisor on the project: “The question we ask is: ‘Could one man’s waste be a resource for somebody else?’”.</p>
<p>Considerable excavation and tunnelling work is required on the project and has produced more than one million m³ of chalk. “We’ve been looking at ways we can re-use the chalk on other sites,” says Jackson.</p>
<p>“Chalk from the tunnels is going to farmers’ fields where it can be mixed into the soil and used to change the Ph balance. It’s also being used for hard-standings or access roads. Chalk on the main site at Peacehaven is staying on-site and used as landscaping.” The wastewater treatment works lie in a natural fold in the landscape and will be given a grass roof so the buildings blend into the downland setting and retain the views of the Downs.</p>
<p>Further use of the chalk is now being made by sending it to a cement works for the production of cement.</p>
<p>Additional waste reduction comes through chipping waste wood that is used as fuel for a local wood-burning generator to produce electricity.</p>
<p>Aerosol cans, normally classed as hazardous waste, are now put into a special machine that pierces them, then extracts the remaining gases through a filter. The filters need to be treated as hazardous waste, with the cans being recycled.</p>
<p>During his 90-minute visit, site personnel will take Lord Henley to the Ovingdean tunnelling site where he can see the excavated chalk being handled.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>22 March 2011</p>
<p>Institution of Civil Engineers’ President, Peter Hansford, visited a Costain site recently as part of his President’s Visit to the North West.</p>
<p>Together with a party of distinguished guests, he visited the Longley Lane project, which is one of the 26 sites that form part of Costain’s £397million Design &amp; Construct PFI Contract to build new waste treatment and recycling facilities for the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority (GMWDA).</p>
<p>The President and his guests were hosted on the visit by staff from GMWDA, Viridor Laing and Viridor Waste, together with several members of the Costain team. The guests were shown around the newly constructed Mechanical Biological Treatment – Anaerobic Digestion (MBT-AD) plant, which will sort and recover recyclable materials, produce high calorific value Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF), for use in a new Thermal Power Station being built at Runcorn, and produce gas from the AD process that will be used to produce electricity to both power the plant and feed back into the national grid network.</p>
<p>Other facilities constructed on the Longley Lane site include a new Household Waste Recycling Centre, a Materials Recovery Facility, a Green Waste shredding facility, new offices, workshops and vehicle washes for Manchester City Council, together with a new Visitor Education Centre, which will be used to inform and educate school children in the value of waste reduction and recycling.  </p>
<p>Alan Butler, ICE NW Regional Director, commenting on the visit said: “The Project in many ways speaks for itself, in both the scope and quality of the facilities being constructed. Peter Hansford, and many of the President’s party, remarked that they were very impressed by the excellent and knowledgeable Costain staff, who are a real credit to the organisation.”</p>
<p>Costain GMW Construction Manager, Paul Howells, commented: “We were very pleased to host the ICE President’s visit to the Longley Lane site, as it presented a chance to showcase the excellent waste recovery and recycling facilities that have been constructed, not only on this site, but throughout the Greater Manchester Waste project.” </p>
<p>Process Operations Manager, Peter McCluskey, added that it was the co-operation being demonstrated by all parties involved in the GMW project that was a major contributor to its overall success.<br />  </p>

<p>A Costain-Skanska joint venture (jv) has won the first package of advance works for stations to be awarded by Crossrail. The jv partners now face the challenge of carrying out major piling and excavation works in one of London’s most exclusive areas.</p>
<p>The project involves the construction of the new station boxes at Crossrail’s Bond Street Station, which will be one of the six new central London stations serving the high-frequency rail link.</p>
<p>The stations will be constructed on five levels below ground, with ticket halls at street level in Davies Street and Hanover Square. Costain will construct the two deep station boxes.  One is a secant piled box that will be excavated and propped and the other a diaphragm walled box that will be excavated at a later date. The main excavation will measure approximately 70m by 30m and 26m deep.</p>
<p>“This is a very exciting project to be involved with,” says Costain’s Project Director, Isabel Coman, “and it will be critical that we undertake the work in a way that is sensitive to this local community and minimises the impact of the construction on their day to day lives.”</p>
<p>“The technical challenges will come from logistics of carrying out these significant works in such a densely populated area in the heart of London’s West End. We will be drawing on our excellent experience of similar works to deliver a successful project.”</p>
<p>Work on the contract is due to start on site at the end of April, with completion due the following year.</p>
<p>When complete, Crossrail will provide a route from Maidenhead in the west through twin-bore 21 km tunnels under central London and out to the east, forking to Shenfield, near Brentwood in Essex and to Abbey Wood in southeast London.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>14 March 2011</p>
<p>Costain is rolling out a series of Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) seminars for top management.</p>
<p>Sector directors and senior managers will attend the seminars, the first of which has just taken place.</p>
<p>In moving safety up the agenda this year there is a particular focus on leadership within the Group “and the best way to demonstrate leadership is for people to be seen as role models and leading the way”, explains Group SHE Director, Peter Fisher.</p>
<p>External SHE consultant, Lawrence Webb, and Fisher outlined the SHE responsibilities of senior management, using Institute of Directors’ guidelines as their benchmark.</p>
<p>“There is a legal requirement [for senior managers] to understand their Health and Safety responsibilities, but this course goes further than this. Legal compliance is a minimum,” explains Fisher. “We go into the other areas we would expect the leaders of an industry-leading company like Costain to promote.”</p>
<p>While changes to SHE-related legislation were explained, Fisher and Webb also spoke about the expectations on senior managers. They not only have to set high standards themselves but ensure that their staff also lead in the way expected of them, says Fisher.</p>
<p>Watching out for SHE-related topics will be a key part of senior managers’ roles when they make site visits,” he adds. “They’ll look to see that the sites have the right resources for SHE and if they are delivering things that the business would expect.</p>
<p>“Our accident rate dropped again slightly last year but we’re quite keen to move it forward further and, to achieve that, senior managers will have to be out in front, driving the process.</p>
<p>“The good news is that they are stepping up to the plate when it comes to these seminars quite willingly…we’re not having to twist their arms.”</p>
<p>One attendee at the first seminar, Group PFI Director, Alistair Handford, was enthusiastic about the experience: “I found it very useful. It is always good to get a bunch of senior managers from around the whole business to sit down on the subject of SHE.</p>
<p>“We have to challenge ourselves to keep up to speed personally and also whether we’re doing all the right things in leading SHE and getting the message across.”</p>
<p>Another of the first group, Project Director, Rail, Lee Davies, adds: “We concentrated on things that, moving forward, are particularly important to the business, such as behavioural safety and occupational health.</p>
<p>“It’s quite surprising how the whole credibility and confidence and support our business gets is really predicated on the fact that our performance in safety and environmental terms is met and delivered on the projects. That credibility and confidence is easily lost and it’s a performance we really trade on as a company.”</p>
<p>Around nine more of the seminars will be held this year and the intention is to make them a regular occurrence every couple of years.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>7 March 2011</p>
<p>Costain Abu Dhabi recently hosted British Standards (BSI) as they undertook surveillance for 9001/18001 (Quality and H&amp;S) approvals, as well as the stage 2 assessment for 14001 (Environmental) approval.</p>
<p>At the closing meeting there were no non conformances for either 18001/9001, and were recommended for 14001 accreditation.</p>
<p>This achievement was all the more important as it has lifted the last potential barrier in their efforts to become the first organisation in Abu Dhabi to receive municipality EHSMS approval as required under the new Environmental Legislation. “We’ve been working very closely with the regulator to be the first organisation to gain this approval,” says Safety, Health, Environment and Quality Manager, Will Richardson-White. “We’re currently looking like the first company to push this through.”</p>
<p>He believes this will give Costain an advantage over its competitors: “This is something that is likely to attract media attention over here and will be good publicity for us. Costain has a strong name in Abu Dhabi and we want to make sure we maximise any opportunities to use this achievement in doing that.”</p>
<p>“This achievement is the result of several months planning involving a combined effort from those implementing the system in Abu Dhabi, through to those providing advice from our Group SHE department in the UK.”<br />  </p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>4 March 2011</p>
<p>The strength of the Costain brand has been recognised once again with the appearance of the 2011 Business Superbrands list, which shows the Company’s reputation growing.</p>
<p>Costain has jumped from 263 to 182 in the rankings, which measure a company’s emotional or tangible advantages over its competitors – advantages that customers recognise and want.</p>
<p>A successful year as the economy slowly recovered, including a string of successfully-completed high-profile projects and a strong forward order book have helped sustain and boost the Company’s reputation in the marketplace and contribute to its improved performance in the annual listing.</p>
<p>Several thousand companies are initially scrutinised for inclusion in the top 500 that make up the Business Superbrands list. These are initially whittled down to a maximum of 1,600 by researchers from Business Superbrand administrators The Centre for Brand Analysis (TCBA), which seeks to understand the performance of brands.</p>
<p>This shortlist is then considered by an Expert Council assembled by TCBA. They judge a candidate on quality (high-grade products and services), reliability (does it deliver consistently against its promises?) and distinction (is it in some way differentiated from its competitors?).</p>
<p>The final 500 are ranked both by the Expert Council and by some 2,000 individual business professionals from around the UK.</p>
<p>Stephen Cheliotis, Chairman of the Expert Council &amp; TCBA’s CEO, comments: “As we enter another difficult year, the resilience of a business can be boosted by its reputation, helping to stimulate demand and loyalty versus weaker-branded rivals.</p>
<p>“The Company and its employees can be extremely proud to be recognised amongst the UK’s leading B2B brands. The achievement reflects the views of experts and professionals who deemed the brand to represent quality, reliability and distinction.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>3 March 2011</p>
<p>The latest phase of Costain’s successful programme of renewing schools in the London Borough of Lewisham is now underway, with work having started this year on a further five establishments.</p>
<p>“Since last August we’ve won around £110 million of work across six projects down here,” says Project Director Brian Fisher.  Deptford Green was signed in August 2010. Four more were signed up on 23 December last year and work started on them immediately after the new year. The most recent project was closed on 16 February and work is already underway.”</p>
<p>Of the recently signed schemes four new-build schools being constructed under the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) scheme, plus two on a design &amp; build basis. All are being constructed as part of the national Building Schools for the Future programme.</p>
<p>The three PFI schools are:<br />• Prendergast Vale (new-build plus refurbishment of a listed building); <br />• Bonus Pastor (new-build);<br />• ASD (a new-build special needs school covering Autistic Spectrum Disorder).</p>
<p>The two design &amp; build projects are Prendergast Hilly Fields (80% new-build, 20% refurbishment of a listed building) and Addey and Stanhope (50% refurbishment and 50% new-build)</p>
<p>In both refurbishments, the buildings are effectively being refitted with facilities to bring them up to 21st century standards.</p>
<p>“They’re all on brownfield sites where we are completely or partly demolishing the old schools,” says Fisher. There are a total of approximately 4000 pupils across the six projects. “Some have moved to temporary sites or buildings, others have been moved into other buildings on the existing sites and we will be building around them.”</p>
<p>Given Lewisham’s location in inner South London, an area hit heavily by air raids during the Second World War, one unusual activity for the team before any work gets underway on the sites is to bring in specialists to conduct a check for buried unexploded bombs. So far, none have been discovered.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>1 March 2011</p>
<p>In a major landmark for the UK’s nuclear industry, Costain has helped close the doors at one of the UK’s earliest reactors. It is now in ‘Safestore’ status until late this century.</p>
<p>Berkeley power station, Gloucestershire, became operational in 1962 as the UK’s first solely commercial nuclear power station with two first-generation Magnox reactors. It ceased generating electricity in 1989. Decommissioning work has been going on since then as part of the lengthy site restoration process.</p>
<p>Costain has been contracted for decommissioning works on Magnox sites throughout the UK including Trawsfynydd and Wylfa in Wales, Hunterston in Scotland and Berkeley, Hinkley Point, Dungeness and Bradwell in England.</p>
<p>Berkeley has been the main focus for both Costain and Magnox within the last two years to ensure that it reached its Safestore status by the end of 2010 – a milestone date set by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA).</p>
<p>This major milestone was achieved in January with the reactor buildings formally entering the passive Safestore status – they are now closed and will be looked after on a care and maintenance basis until 2074 to allow residual radiation levels to decay naturally, to the point where the buildings can be demolished with more conventional techniques.</p>
<p>Simon Attwell, Costain’s Project Manager at Berkeley, notes that the framework contract extends to other Magnox sites at Bradwell, Sizewell, Hinkley Point and Dungeness, with the main emphasis being on Bradwell over the next five years.</p>
<p>Work at Berkeley follows the standard Magnox pattern of what is referred to as a ‘campaign approach’, with a steady flow of work packages rather than large peaks and troughs of contract awards.</p>
<p>The care and maintenance status means that continual work, such as re-roofing buildings, will be required to ensure the sites continue to meet the stringent safety rules laid down by the UK Government’s Nuclear Installations Inspectorate.</p>
<p>Costain has worked closely with Magnox to deliver best-value solutions possible within the allocated budget.</p>
<p>“We’ve carried out around 30 work packages connected with Safestore,” says Attwell. “This has included deplanting – removing equipment, reconfiguring the electrical supplies and building management systems to ensure access to the reactors is not necessary during the Safestore period. Essentially they are shutting the doors for 70 years, so anything that could deteriorate and become a safety hazard has been removed or put in a position where it can’t be a risk any more.”</p>
<p>While Magnox understandably aims for tried and trusted techniques in such a sensitive environment, some aspects of Costain’s work have been innovative. A careful study of how to remove pipework mounted high on the walls, for example, saw abseilers called in to handle the work, rather than more conventional scaffolders.</p>
<p>On a standard site, much of the work would be deemed straightforward. However, notes Attwell: “The site still operates under its nuclear licence; this means there are necessarily tight controls and safety standards that are much higher than on a conventional work site.” Careful and extensive checking of working methods by Magnox means that work necessarily proceeds at a measured pace.</p>
<p>In its time at Berkeley, Costain has achieved a zero Accident Frequency Rate among its site team and subcontractors.</p>
<p>Commenting on achieving Safestore status, Costain’s Managing Director, Infrastructure, Darren James adds: “By working closely with the site operators Magnox and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority we have reached a significant milestone. The experience gained in taking the Berkeley reactors into Safestore will also provide valuable knowledge and expertise that will assist with taking the remaining Magnox reactors into Care and Maintenance.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>24 February 2011</p>
<p>Passengers heading off on holiday through London’s Gatwick Airport North Terminal should find life just a little smoother this summer, as Costain works to expand security facilities there.</p>
<p>Costain, which is classed by Gatwick’s owner Global Infrastructure Partners as one of its ‘complex build integrators’ capable of handling difficult tasks under a framework contract, has to construct two extra security lanes by a strict 1 June deadline, to be ready for the summer peak period.</p>
<p>Once complete, the extra two lanes will allow an extra 400 passengers an hour to pass through security.</p>
<p>The job, which began immediately after the Christmas break, is very challenging both in timescale and location, says Costain’s Head of Airport Relations Kevin Harman. “Being located in the middle of the terminal creates logistical challenges for both staff and materials. The terminal has passengers in it throughout the day and night so it is important to phase the work in order to minimise any noise or dust and thereby maintain the best possible experience for passengers.</p>
<p>“Our aim is to work behind hoarding so the passengers have no idea major construction is underway.”</p>
<p>The second major problem, says Harman, is that the team have to create the lanes by driving a tunnel through a large mechanical riser carrying heating and venting ducts.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the riser is the size of a large domestic lounge, so there is room in which to divert the ducting. As part of the work, an easyJet ticket desk will have to be demolished and several shop units relocated, which requires considerable liaison with the airline and the Gatwick retail team.</p>
<p>“It’s not a massive job, but it’s an important one for the airport,” says Harman. “It must open on time.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>23 February 2011</p>
<p>The team behind the major remodelling of Farringdon Station, in central London, is so busy it has hardly had time to reflect on its efforts over Christmas and New Year, but the opportunity for a lengthy period of uninterrupted work was well and truly seized.</p>
<p>“We had two lengthy timeslots of 90 and 100 hours where we could work without either the London Underground or First Capital Connect trains running,” says Construction Director of the Costain/Laing O’Rourke joint venture, Daniel Powrie. “The team successfully completed a significant amount of critical work.”</p>
<p>The project – a £189million contract that includes lengthening the Network Rail platforms to take 12 car trains, refurbishing the existing listed station building, building a new station entrance at Turnmill Street, creating a new train shed roof and a new integrated ticket hall (ITH) for Crossrail and Thameslink services – took a major leap forward as most of the country was relaxing over the festive period.</p>
<p>One of the major achievements was the placing of 18 metre, 27t steel beams and associated columns for the ITH placed over the national rail lines.</p>
<p>Much of this steelwork was not only heavy but also very complicated and involved the use of a 600t crawler crane – something of a concern with so many residential properties around the site was the noise these operations would make. However, through the implementation of best practise methods noise levels were very carefully managed. The result? “Not a single complaint from the public over the entire festive period,” says Daniel.</p>
<p>A huge variety of work was tackled, both the demolition of old structures and construction of new ones. A heritage balustrade had to be carefully removed to allow work to be carried out on the station’s concourse. A new gateline was installed at the station side entrance in Turnmill Street, and the installation of trackside foundations for emergency stairs was successfully completed.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious visible signs that work was progressing was the demolition of the Cowcross street bridge deck, which forms the street outside the station’s main entrance. The demolition of this bridge was critical to progress of the project and the achievement of 12 car functionality in December.</p>
<p>Normally, the team has to squeeze in whatever work adjacent to the rail lines is possible in the three to four hours or so that the Tube or First Capital Connect trains are not running overnight, together with weekend possessions. So the team made the most of its extended period of access.</p>
<p> “We didn’t stop,” says Powrie. “And it was so well-planned that it went like clockwork and the entire team deserve a huge pat on the back for a brilliant effort and to cap it all we carried out over 50,000 man-hours without a single minor accident or injury.”</p>

<p>The Costain Team working on the Dwr Cymru Welsh Water Framework is celebrating after exceeding four years without a RIDDOR (Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations).  This remarkable milestone was reached on 31 January 2011 and has seen two million manhours worked without a RIDDOR over the four years.</p>
<p>John Madden, Framework Director said: "To reach the four year mark without a reportable accident is a wonderful achievement for the whole team.  Our impressive safety record highlights the continued commitment to health and safety by all Costain staff on the Framework and throughout our supply chain".</p>
<p>The team continues to promote safety awareness through numerous incentive schemes across its projects John goes on to say: “However, continual focus has to be applied in order to maintain this record and this year Costain Behavioural Safety (CBS) will be a primary initiative to aid the Framework’s drive for continual improvement”.</p>
<p>The Framework intends to appropriately mark this milestone with all the Costain Framework staff and supply chain who have contributed to this superb safety achievement.<br /> <br />Ends</p>]]></description>

<p>Costain Energy &amp; Process’s Teesside office has marked the third year of operation with a double success.</p>
<p>The regional operation has just been recommended for certification for both BS EN ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management and BS EN ISO 14001:2004 Environmental Management, by assessor BSI Management Systems.</p>
<p>“We have this certification at Energy &amp; Process head office in Manchester, obviously,” says Senior Quality Assurance Engineer, Simon Evans, “and we wanted to extend that cover to the office here.”</p>
<p>Although the Costain name is a guarantee of high standards, ISO certification provides an official stamp of approval should it be required by clients.</p>
<p>“Teesside Operation report into the Hydrocarbons and Chemicals sector and will primarily be pursuing midstream and downstream opportunities but will also remain open minded regarding revamp and upgrade opportunities in the Power sector,” commented General Manager, Peter Laing.</p>
<p>Costain Energy &amp; Process has a successful track record in the Teesside region, having previously delivered major capital projects in the region for Conoco Phillips, Enron and ICI.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>8 February 2011</p>
<p>An evening of innovation was on the menu for an audience of Costain’s top customers and stakeholders in London last week.</p>
<p>The central London event showcased the official launch of the Costain ‘app’ for the Apple iPad. The application can deliver a plethora of timely information to customers and stakeholders, including news from Costain and from around the construction industry as well as commentary on developments such as new legislation or policy changes that may affect the sector. Information available through the device is updated regularly.</p>
<p>The app has been available since last November, with the iPad increasingly being used by senior Executives, says Costain’s Group Strategy &amp; Business Development Director, Stephen Wells.</p>
<p>“Costain Board members have had iPads since last October and Executive Board meetings are now conducted entirely without paper.</p>
<p>“We’re now rolling it out across the senior leadership team. Increasingly it’s seen as the way to connect both internally and with the external world.”</p>
<p>Wells hosted last week’s event, giving a presentation on the Choosing Costain strategy and on ‘Communicating in the 21st century’.</p>
<p>Group Technical Director, Bill Hewlett and Group Innovation Manager, Tim Embley meanwhile, presented a series of five case studies that demonstrated innovation and the application of technology ‘at pace’ in ways that delivered cost savings while also giving a glimpse of future technological advances.</p>
<p>As well as their Costain roles, both men have an input into organisations that have an influence on the construction industry and beyond. Hewlett is a vice-president of the Institution of Civil Engineers while Embley chairs a Government committee on infrastructure research.</p>
<p>Group Finance Director, Tony Bickerstaff and Group Systems &amp; Technology Director, Bill Price presented the ‘app’ and the fact that it is ‘first to market in the sector’. They also covered the Company’s aspirations on how it revolutionises communications between Costain and its customers and stakeholders.</p>
<p>Guests had a chance to network and also to win an iPad in an ‘innovation quiz’.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>7 February 2011</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales has praised industry’s assistance in helping communities and vulnerable people regain their places as productive members of society, as Costain prepares to show its industry peers how it is helping in the process.</p>
<p>Chief Executive, Andrew Wyllie, and Group Strategy &amp; Business Development Director, Stephen Wells, were at St James’s Palace in central London last week for the annual feedback session of Seeing Is Believing (SIB), a programme staged by the charity Business in the Community (BITC), of which Prince Charles is president.</p>
<p>Every year, around nine SIB sessions are staged around the UK where blue chip companies invite around 60 Chief Executives and senior Directors to show them how they are translating corporate responsibility principles into reality on the ground.</p>
<p>Audience members go back to their companies, hopefully sufficiently fired up to start practical corporate responsibility programmes of their own.</p>
<p>Wells added that Prince Charles had said he was “immensely proud” of the SIB programme, which he started 20 years ago. “He was very pleased with the results it’s yielding but that there is always more to do.”</p>
<p>Wells has seen the benefits of this at first hand. Late last year he attended an SIB meeting at Feltham Young Offenders’ facility in West London, where the capital’s mayor, Boris Johnson, has been supporting a programme – known as Project Heron – designed to cut the rate of re-offending among youths.</p>
<p>Remarkably, a combination of apprenticeships plus other work and life skills has seen the re-offending rate plummet from a typical 78% to just 16-18%.</p>
<p>Costain is now gearing up to show its industry peers the results of its own efforts in this field.</p>
<p>On 7 April, Wyllie is due to lead an SIB session in London where Costain will roll out its activities related to taking on disadvantaged and unemployed youngsters on National Grid and Crossrail projects in the capital.</p>
<p>However, as Wells who will be the event’s co-sponsor comments, Costain is not doing this for charitable reasons. “It’s got to be good for business. It’s all about the skills agenda, putting people back to work and equipping them with skills for the long term.”</p>
<p>There are also solid financial benefits in such programmes for UK plc. It costs the taxpayer up to £60,000 a year to keep a young offender locked up, for example, when they could be earning a wage and not being a burden on society.</p>
<p>The April session will show senior Executives what Costain is doing in this field: “The idea is to expose them to real apprentices and young offenders and meet the people who are delivering our skills agenda, such as Group Talent &amp; Skills Manager, Jeremy Galpin.”</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>4 February 2011</p>
<p>Costain is pleased to announce it has been awarded two airport contracts. The first is an £18.6 million contract, as principal contractor, to refurbish Manchester Airport’s main runway, Runway 1, under an existing Framework agreement. </p>
<p>The Runway 1 Project will continue through to September 2011 and the Airport will remain operational 24 hours a day during the runway closures period by utilising the 2nd runway.</p>
<p>Costain has also been appointed by BAA as one of the suppliers for the Local Project Integrator (LPI) at London Heathrow, the world’s busiest international airport.  The contract, which is anticipated to have a value of approximately £8 million per annum, will run for up to four years and will commence in March 2011.  This award builds on the success of similar contracts at Gatwick and Manchester Airports and the early completion of a £25 million interchange for Gatwick. </p>
<p>Commenting on the contract awards, <strong>Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive of Costain</strong>, said:</p>
<p><em><strong>“We are delighted to have been awarded these contracts for Manchester and London Heathrow airports. The contracts represent significant investment in the UK’s infrastructure and will help the airports meet the growing needs of passengers in the future.”</strong></em></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>26 January 2011</p>
<p>Planning permission for a £3.5million scheme to improve underground reservoirs at Coundon in Coventry was given the go-ahead on 6 January 2011 by Coventry City Council.</p>
<p>Costain is the principal contractor carrying out the improvements, which will ensure the long-term security of drinking water to around 10,000 Severn Trent Water customers.</p>
<p>The scheme will involve the demolition of the three existing reservoirs and the construction of a single new reservoir on the same site. The improvements are expected to take 12 months to complete.</p>
<p>Costain was actively involved with the planning process, carrying out letter drops to more than 400 households in the area, organising and hosting a public consultation event attended by around 70 local residents, meeting with the local residents’ association and ongoing consultation with around 90 allotment holders, some of whom will be directly affected by the construction works.</p>
<p>Costain Framework Director, Bill Lomas, said: ‘By proactively engaging with the public during the planning process we were able to allay many people’s concerns about construction activities and ensure they had every opportunity to comment on the plans as part of the planning process. Through good communication and information we helped to minimise the risk of objections to the planning application, which could have led to a far lengthier planning process.’</p>
<p>‘Our early community engagement has led to highly positive relationships with local people and we look forward to working closely with them over the coming year as the scheme develops.’</p>
<p>Derek James, Asset Creation Area Manager at Severn Trent Water, added: ‘Severn Trent Water is undertaking essential maintenance works at Coundon Reservoir as part of an ongoing programme of capital investment in its water supply and distribution system. Severn Trent Water and our supply chain partner, Costain, are committed to delivering excellence in customer and community care.</p>
<p>‘The excellent work undertaken to date engaging with the local community will be continued during the construction phase of the project to ensure the customer and the local community are at the heart of thinking when planning and undertaking construction works at Coundon Reservoir.’</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>24 January 2011</p>
<p>Costain’s Abu Dhabi operation is spreading its wings as it widens its portfolio of work in the emirate.</p>
<p>For much of the past three decades, the Company’s work has been concentrated on Das Island, some 50 miles off the emirate’s coast, where it continues to work with several subsidiaries of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), one of the world’s top 10 oil and gas companies.</p>
<p>Originally, Costain concentrated on providing ‘shutdown services’ – essentially repair and upgrading work when sections of the refinery on the island closed for periodic maintenance.</p>
<p>Increasingly however, says Commercial Manager, Rob Davies, its scope has expanded and today it operates as an Engineering, Procurement and Construction Company.</p>
<p>Recent contract awards, for example, have included environmental work to reduce emissions from the ADGAS plant on Das Island.</p>
<p>Costain has also recently moved on to nearby Zirku Island to replace water pipelines for the Zakum Development Company, which manages several oilfields in the emirate.</p>
<p>Prospects for future business remain good, says Davies. While much newsprint has been expended over the past two years detailing the economic problems of neighbouring Dubai, Abu Dhabi possesses 90% of the UAE’s oil and gas reserves and has been largely unaffected by the global recession.</p>
<p>To help support Costain’s expansion plans, the Company has signed a three-year agreement with Speedy Asset International Services to supply all non-operated plant and equipment. Speedy Hire established itself in the Gulf in 2009 but was already a strategic partner to Costain in the UK and this important supply chain relationship has now been extended overseas.</p>
<p>The agreement was signed after six months of market research, business strategy and commercial structuring to ensure mutual benefits would flow from it, says Rob Davies. By securing most of Costain’s business in this market, Speedy has a better understanding of Costain’s requirements and can plan its own workload more accurately, while Costain will also benefit financially through placing a larger volume of work with one supplier.</p>
<p>“It’s worthwhile from Speedy’s point of view because although for them we’re a relatively small customer in the UAE, we are viewed as one of their blue-chip customers and they are pleased to have secured this agreement with Costain.”</p>
<p>The Speedy contract is likely to be the prototype for other, similar deals in the UAE, he adds.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>18 January 2011</p>
<p>Costain has been awarded an Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) contract by the Highways Agency to design and construct a major scheme to relieve congestion and improve safety on the A556 between the M56 and M6 motorways in the North West.</p>
<p>The scheme will see the A556 between Knutsford and Bowdon in Cheshire, which is used by 51,000 vehicles a day, upgraded to dual carriageway standard.</p>
<p>A bypass will take traffic away from the communities of Bucklow Hill, Mere and Over Tabley and Junction 7 of the M56 will be upgraded.</p>
<p>Commenting on the contract award, <strong>Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive of Costain</strong>, said:</p>
<p><strong><em>“We are delighted to have been awarded this ECI contract with </em></strong><strong><em>such an important client and one that further strengthens our position as one of the UK’s leading solution providers in the Highways sector.</em></strong><strong><em>”</em></strong></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>17 January 2011</p>
<p>Costain is pleased to announce that it has received the go-ahead from Surrey County Council to construct the new Walton bridge as part of a £32.3 million scheme, creating the first major road crossing over the River Thames in almost 20 years.</p>
<p>The crossing, between Walton and Shepperton, is due to be completed by 2013 and will replace two temporary bridges in the area.  The bridge will provide improved access to several schools, major employers and shopping centres.</p>
<p>Around 34,000 vehicles use the current road bridge on week days.</p>
<p>The government has agreed to contribute just under £23.9 million to the project with the council providing a further £8.5 million, which has already been budgeted for.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive of Costain, said:</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>“We are delighted to be awarded this contract by Surrey County Council, which is the first road crossing over the River Thames to be built in 20 years.”</strong></em></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>11 January 2011</p>
<p>Costain’s continuing commitment to safety has been recognised by one of its projects winning a new national award in conjunction with designer Atkins.</p>
<p>Costain/Atkins on the A40 Penblewin to Slebech Park Improvement Scheme in Pembrokeshire, southwest Wales, took the Association for Project Safety’s (APS) first Project of the Year award.</p>
<p>Its judging panel considered that the A40 improvement project demonstrated good integration of safety and environmental considerations into the fundamentals of the project.</p>
<p>Monitoring, reporting and communicating systems were particularly marked out for praise, including public liaison. The Construction Environmental Management plan, which included good practice measures in the reuse of materials on-site, was also commented upon favourably.</p>
<p>“The judges were looking for evidence of Health and Safety risk management and how it gets moved on from the design stage and taken right through to construction and feedback,” explained A40 Project Manager, Mark Young. “We had much evidence of this but the primary source was the existence and management of the Hazard Log and our future intention to close it out and provide feed back.</p>
<p>“Through the Early Contractor Involvement stage we designed out as many of the hazards as we could with Atkins and our supply chain. As we progressed to site, residual hazards were all stated on the drawings; it was a good way of demonstrating an audit trail showing that risk management had been carried on through the various stages of the project and highlighting the required start point in the construction stage. Together with our internal SHE management systems and the application of other best practice this has been highly effective.”</p>
<p>The A40 project for the Welsh Assembly Government got underway in February 2009, with the aim of creating just under 5km of ‘2+1’ carriageway and 1.5km of side roads, together with a series of bridges, underpasses, drainage systems and water treatment ponds.</p>
<p>The project runs through the Eastern Cleddau Special Area of Conservation, which has necessitated making provision to protect local wildlife, including bats, otters and badgers. The route also borders the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>10 January 2011</p>
<p>Costain is aiming to carve an even bigger niche for itself in the highways maintenance sector through innovation and differentiating itself from its competitors.</p>
<p>In the wake of the Government’s Comprehensive Spending Review local councils, highway authorities and national agencies in both England and Scotland are demanding more for less from their contractors, says Highways Maintenance Services Director, Chris Tyerman.</p>
<p>Some competitors are choosing to meet these demands simply through aggressive pricing, reducing their margins and profit expectations. Costain, on the other hand, is seeking to take a more nuanced approach and seeking contracts where its greater sophistication and breadth of service can make itself felt.</p>
<p>“Where it’s a very traditional term maintenance contract and the customer tells you exactly what he wants you to do and pays you a set fee, we don’t think we can add value to that and so we’re not generally pursuing that type of contract,” says Tyerman.</p>
<p>“We’re more interested in opportunities where a specialised team needs to be developed and where solutions and customer service are as important as construction, reflecting the ‘Choosing Costain’ strategy – developing our service to customers that includes consultation and aftercare services as well as construction.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at some strategic relationships with partners that will make our offering unique. We’re looking at innovation, strategic out-sourcing and bundled services. For example, we’re involved in joint ventures with Serco and Capita Symonds to deliver services and differentiate ourselves.”</p>
<p>Taking on outsourced staff transferred from local authorities as part of these commissions will be one of the more challenging aspects that Costain has to deal with, as these new personnel have to be inducted into the company’s way of working.</p>
<p>Being choosy on the type of contract it bids for does not mean a lack of work for the tendering department, however. Bids are being prepared or have been lodged for no fewer than five highway maintenance contracts around the country. Costain currently has four Maintenance Area Contracts in operation.</p>

<p>Costain has been appointed by Lewisham Council to rebuild four more schools at a total value of £71 million after financial close was reached on the fourth phase of its Building Schools for the Future (‘BSF’) project.</p>
<p>Work will shortly begin on building a brand new special school for pupils with autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), Prendergast Vale College, a new all-age school, and the rebuilding of two secondary schools, Bonus Pastor Catholic College and Prendergast Hilly Fields College. <br /> <br />Three of the schools (Bonus Pastor Catholic College, Prendergast Vale College and the new ASD school), with a total capital expenditure of £53 million, will be delivered under a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) package, giving significant financial benefits to the Council. <br /> <br />The PFI will be delivered by Learning21, a consortium that includes Costain Engineering &amp; Construction and Babcock International.  The design and construction of the schools is being undertaken by Costain, while the facilities and ICT services will be provided by Babcock. <br /> <br />The fourth school, Prendergast Hilly Fields College, will be delivered through a £18 million design and build contract with Costain.</p>
<p>Each school will have the very latest in information and communication technology (ICT) and fully integrated facilities management services. All work is due for completion by September 2013.</p>
<p>Commenting on the award, <strong>Andrew Wyllie</strong>, the <strong>Chief Executive of Costain</strong>, said:</p>
<p><strong><em>"Costain is delighted to have reached financial close on the fourth phase of its BSF partnership with the London Borough of Lewisham, and to be part of the on-going delivery of quality education services to the young people of Lewisham."</em></strong></p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>4 January 2011</p>
<p>A groundbreaking ceremony was held recently to start officially the construction of the last phase of the Peripheral Distributor Road (PDR) in Wales.</p>
<p>Neath Port Talbot Council has teamed up with contractor Costain to deliver the £107million ‘Harbour Way’ road link, the largest local authority transport project in Wales to be supported by the Welsh Assembly Government and European funding.</p>
<p>Creating 600 jobs during the 33 month construction period, the flagship project will provide the last 4.5km link from Afan Way to the A48 near junction 38 of the M4.</p>
<p>This final phase will make available up to 210 hectares of brownfield land for development to complement the Council’s regeneration plans for the waterfront from Margam in the east to Fabian Way in the west.</p>
<p>Council Leader, Ali Thomas, Deputy First Minister, Ieuan Wyn Jones and Costain’s Managing Director Infrastructure, Darren James attended the launch at the newly built visitor centre located on North Bank Road in Port Talbot.</p>
<p>A purpose built visitor centre has been included in the site offices and it will be open to the public every Wednesday from 1pm to 6pm. The public will be able to view an exhibition showing the route of the new road and DVD showing a virtual ‘fly through’ of the completed project.</p>
<p>The visitor centre will also be available for pre arranged visits outside these hours by schools and community groups and arrangements can be made through the website.</p>
<p>Costain is also looking forward to working closely with local schools and colleges and recently sponsored the Institute of Chartered Engineers ‘Engineering Team Challenge’, a competition open to all secondary schools in the region, at Swansea University.</p>
<p>Up to date information on the project as it progresses can be found by visiting <a href="http://www.harbourwayproject.com">www.harbourwayproject.com</a></p>
<p>Councillor Thomas said: “This strategic road will provide an attractive gateway to the town and open up development opportunities along the waterfront, in particular the Harbourside and Port Talbot town centre regeneration areas.</p>
<p>“It will benefit local communities, visitors and businesses alike and attract new investment and employment opportunities, not only during the construction period, but for generations to come. It will also improve access to local amenities and leisure facilities within the county borough, bolstering its already expanding tourism economy.”</p>
<p>Deputy First Minister, Ieuan Wyn Jones, who is also the Minister for the Economy and Transport, said: "Despite challenging economic times we are determined to invest in capital projects that will bring long-term structural and economic benefits.</p>
<p>“Our new policy of Economic Renewal, underlines the importance of building the right infrastructure to boost our economy and  supporting people, communities and businesses – and I am  confident that once completed this road will prove of great benefit  for South-West Wales as a whole.”</p>
<p>Managing Director Infrastructure at Costain, Darren James, added: “Costain is delighted to be working in partnership with Neath Port Talbot Council to deliver another major infrastructure project in South Wales funded through resources provided by the Welsh Assembly Government and the European Convergence Fund.</p>
<p>“Costain is fully committed to constructing the scheme utilising local resources and employing local people, increasing the skills base and providing a boost to the local economy.”</p>

<p>Costain takes to the water - or at least, the water’s edge - next month when it mounts a presence at the London Boat Show, which starts on January 7, 2011.</p>
<p>A team will be heading to the ExCeL Centre in the capital’s Docklands to present the attractions of the Alcaidesa Marina to thousands of members of the UK’s yachting community.</p>
<p>The marina, located at La Linea, Spain, immediately adjacent to Gibraltar, opened for business in the summer. The Boat Show presents a great opportunity to bring it to the attention of the sailors and enthusiasts flocking to the 10-day event, says Graduate QS, William Waller, currently on secondment to Group Property.</p>
<p>"It represents a good opportunity to fill as many berths as possible or create long-term rentals. On top of that, we just want to raise awareness of the product," he says. Its position at the Mediterranean’s gateway to the Atlantic gives it a major boost in terms of attracting trade. Its modern facilities, including wider berths able to handle modern, larger vessels plus wi-fi connections at every berth (with television connections also available at some) will also play a role in enticing traffic.</p>
<p>As well as attracting potential users, he hopes the show will also attract commercial investors who may want to set up operations, such as cafes or other facilities, at Alcaidesa.</p>
<p>Around 100 of the 624 water berths have been occupied - some permanently, others by transiting craft - since Alcaidesa Marina opened for business in the summer. The next phase of development, a dry dock and repair yard with travel lift, will add a further 176 berths and should be completed by May 2011.</p>
<p>These attractions will be further selling points, says Waller, as few marinas in the region have such facilities.</p>

<p>More than 2,300 teenagers were able to take a look at the construction and engineering industry during a special careers event attended by 4Delivery and Costain on the South Coast.</p>
<p><em>Your Future, Your Choice</em> attracted more than 70 companies to the event. It was organised by Brighton &amp; Hove Education Business Partnership (EBP) and held at Brighton Racecourse. Through EBP programmes, employers can help raise the aspirations of young people and can become directly involved in initiatives that encourage young people to develop key skills required for the world of work.</p>
<p>The target audience was pupils aged 14-16 from schools in the area. Both the 4D joint venture consisting of Costain, Veolia Water and MWH, and Costain itself had stands at the event.</p>
<p>“We laid on activities for pupils at the stands,” said George Hilliar, 4D’s Training Manager. “We got them to build a tetrahedron using wooden poles and rubber bands, or to build a Lego tower as tall as possible within 30 seconds.”</p>
<p>While doing so, the Costain and 4D teams were able to talk to the pupils and hopefully plant the germ of an idea about careers in the construction and engineering industries in their heads. “It was certainly worthwhile,” said Hilliar, who found himself being interviewed by BBC South television news, which was filming a report on the event.</p>
<p>He appeared on the evening’s regional news programme although sadly some of his comments relating to Costain’s active recruitment programme for graduates and apprentices ended up on the cutting room floor.</p>
<p>4Delivery is delivering environmental improvements for Southern Water across the South East, including a new £300 million scheme to bring cleaner seas to Sussex.</p>

<p>In a move that reflects credit on Costain and offers it an opportunity to improve the business prospects both for itself and the construction sector, Group Technical Director, Bill Hewlett has been appointed a vice-president of the Institution of Civil Engineers.</p>
<p>Hewlett, an ICE member since 1990 and a Fellow for the past three years, will serve a three-year term as vice-president for membership and ethics.</p>
<p>The role includes chairing the membership panel that maintains the infrastructure supporting people aiming to join the institution and reviews their applications. It also aims to ensure that the need for ethical behaviour in the job is understood.</p>
<p>The role requires a substantial commitment in time, says Hewlett, typically a day a week.</p>
<p>This effort and commitment does bring returns. “I see some very strong benefits for Costain. It’s a highly visible signal that Costain promotes professionalism. I think that’s important to our people as well as to our supply chain and customers.</p>
<p>“As far as our people are concerned, many are striving both in and beyond their daily work to develop themselves to achieve professional qualifications.” The company’s close involvement with the ICE gives a signal to staff that we value such qualifications, he said.</p>
<p>“As far as customers are concerned, the message is about what we stand for and that we are prepared to offer leadership to the profession, that we’re leaders, not followers.”</p>
<p>From Costain’s perspective, everything that can be gleaned from his role that provides insight into qualification and professional development is helpful.</p>
<p>And from a business point of view, the position gives Costain access to people in Government and other stakeholders in the marketplace: “I will do what I can to ensure that the priorities of our customers are represented at that level.”</p>

<p>Dr. Jonathan Mark Bunch, Costain Design Safety Consultant, attended a seminar in Oman recently and presented a paper describing the findings of the Buncefield enquiry and Costain’s approach to best practice in safety assessment on existing plant.</p>
<p>The technical seminar, hosted by the Gas Processors Association Gulf Co-operation Chapter, was entitled Process Safety Management in the Gas Processing Industry. Dr. Bunch’s paper described the devastation caused by the explosion and subsequent fire at the Buncefield oil storage depot in Hertfordshire in 2005, and the findings of the enquiry into the incident which has had a profound effect on the way safety risk assessment is carried out in the UK.</p>
<p>The paper went on to describe the approach used by Costain to assess safety risk on existing plant. Taking into account the findings of the Buncefield enquiry and the concerns of industry, the Costain system uses different levels of assessment to quantify the identified risks and address them in appropriate detail. This has the advantage of focussing time and resources on the higher risks, and reduces the time required to carry out the risk assessment while ensuring the safety of the resulting design is robust.</p>
<p>The presentation was well received by delegates at the seminar, which included representatives from a number of oil and gas operating companies from across the Gulf region. The paper presented an opportunity to learn from the experience in the UK, and highlighted the relevance of Costain’s approach to design safety for hydrocarbon facilities in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Costain’s record of successful work with Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust has continued with the early completion of a new child and adolescent mental health unit.</p>
<p>The project involved refurbishing and altering a former old people’s home to enable the Trust to increase the provision of adolescent mental health services in the area. The building will also provide highly specialised assessment services for those with learning difficulties and mental health problems.</p>
<p>The £6.5 million project required Costain to prop up sections of the roof in the 6,000m² single-storey building so internal walls could be demolished, creating larger rooms, plus education and therapy areas, said Project Manager Dave Johnson. External landscaping rounded off the project.</p>
<p>As often the case when working in hospitals, a major problem facing the team was to carry out the work while hospital services carried on around it. “The phasing and logistics had to be carefully planned to ensure the building remained safe for patients, parents and staff,” said Dave. Mechanical &amp; Electrical services also had to be kept live.”</p>
<p>Work started in September last year and the building was handed over six weeks ahead of schedule this autumn.</p>
<p>It was the third successful project in a row carried out for the Trust. The level of customer satisfaction can perhaps be gauged from the fact that a further contract has just been awarded to Costain to create two new operating theatres in a new building, as well as refurbishing the Accident &amp; Emergency department. Early feasibility work is already underway.</p>

<p>Costain Energy &amp; Process has been shortlisted for three
prestigious industry awards in recent weeks for its innovative
solution for the removal of nitrogen from natural gas, and has been
highly commended for its nomination.</p>

<p>Nitrogen is frequently found as an inert component of raw
natural gas. Its presence leads to poor fuel combustion, especially
if present in high concentrations.&nbsp; On a commercial scale,
cryogenic distillation is recognised as the only cost effective
technology for the removal of nitrogen, with a typical facility
generating revenue of approximately £250 million per annum of gas
which could otherwise not be sold into a pipeline system. Costain's
proprietary cryogenic distillation process offers a 5% reduction in
power consumption over conventional methods, a significant saving
in cost and carbon emissions over the lifetime of the plant. The
process also reduces capital, maintenance and operating costs.</p>

<p>The solution was shortlisted for both the Energy award and the
Core Chemical Engineering award in the Institution of Chemical
Engineers (IChemE) annual awards, and the Energy Institute's
Innovation award.</p>

<p>The IChemE award ceremony, which was attended by chemical
engineering professionals from a wide selection of major companies
and academic institutions, saw shortlisted entries from a diverse
range of applicants from Shell and Scottish Power to universities
in the UK and across the globe. Costain's nitrogen rejection
solution was judged to be the runner up in the Core Chemical
Engineering category and awarded the Highly Commended
certificate.</p>

<p>IChemE CEO, David Brown, said: "Being shortlisted in the IChemE
awards really does demonstrate work of the highest standard and
there are plenty of shortlisted entries from previous years that
have used their success at the IChemE awards as a springboard to
greater things."</p>

<p>Costain's Hydrocarbons &amp; Chemicals Sector Director, Frank
Millar, said of the Highly Commended award: "Costain has a proud
history in this advanced process engineering application and we
welcome this award, and the recognition of our continued efforts to
improve the efficiency and environmental characteristics of the
nitrogen rejection process."</p>

<p>The Costain Group is one of Britain's 'most admired'
construction companies according to a major new survey.</p>

<p>Management Today magazine has published its annual 'Most Admired
Companies' league table which finds out which companies are admired
by top executives throughout the land.</p>

<p>In the Heavy Construction league, Costain moved into second
place (last year 4th) with Balfour Beatty occupying number one
position. Costain was ahead of Kier, Keller, Galliford Try, Morgan
Sindall, Henry Boot, T Clarke and MJ Gleeson.</p>

<p>Overall, in the 'Most Admired' companies league table comprising
230 well known names, Costain was placed 93rd equal with AMEC. The
Company was placed 88th the previous year and the slight fall no
doubt reflected this year's headlines about how spending cuts would
affect the construction industry.</p>

<p>However, Costain's placing in the top 100 put it ahead of some
of the nation's best known names including Severn Trent, Legal and
General Group, William Hill, Investec, Standard Life, BT Group,
Taylor Wimpey and Abbey.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[
<p>6 December 2010</p>

<p>Costain is actively looking at increasing its pool of tunnelling
specialists as several major national contracts loom.</p>

<p>Power and water projects form the two main sectors likely to
require extensive tunnelling works in the next few years.</p>

<p>Tunnelling is a potentially lucrative field for Costain, says
new Tunnelling Operations Director, Stephen Meadowcroft as the
Company has relatively few rivals. "There aren't many companies
that have that expertise. Having tunnelling in our armoury is a
strength."</p>

<p>The current catchword in the power sector is 'resilience', says
Meadowcroft.&nbsp; In order to ensure that the power networks can
continue to deliver Britain's energy needs in the future much new
infrastructure will need to be built over the coming years.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To ensure Londoners can continue to enjoy safe, secure and reliable
electricity supplies National Grid is embarking on a major
replacement programme over the next decade and Costain has won a
portion of the associated work on the tunnels that will house the
new cabling.</p>

<p>The London Cable Replacement Tunnel will run across the capital
from Hackney in the east to Willesden in the west. It will go via
Kensal Green and from there, another tunnel will be driven to
Wimbledon in southwest London - a total of 33km. Work is due to
start by the end of this year, with tunnelling complete by
2014.</p>

<p>Developing this theme Mike Napier, Strategy and Business
Development Director for Infrastructure, adds: "Many of the
underground high-voltage cables serving our large cities are
nearing the end of their lives. Digging up main routes into London
to replace them would cause severe disruption so tunnelling under
the capital is the most effective way to secure our energy supply
for future generations."</p>

<p>Additionally, the Government's planned construction of a new
generation of nuclear power stations, as well as new coal and
wind-power stations, will need to be connected to the UK's power
network.</p>

<p>Although the new nuclear stations will be located alongside
their predecessors around the country, "The output from them is
going to be very much greater so, in crude terms, they need more
cables to link in to the national grid," explains Napier. They will
also require tunnels to dispose of cooling water out to sea.</p>

<p>Despite the forthcoming cuts in government expenditure, the
pressing need for more electricity capacity should mean that the
new power stations escape the axe, both men believe.</p>

<p>Costain has recently re-emphasised its tunnelling credentials
with the successful completion of a contract in West Ham, London,
to remove the threat of sewer flooding to several hundred homes.
And work is nearly 50% completed on 11km of tunnels to bring the
wastewater treatment of the Brighton area up to modern
standards.</p>

Strategy &amp; Business Development Director, Stephen Wells. "We
want to communicate in the most modern way and the iPad is an
integral part of that process.</p>

<p>"Now we can offer through our website and the 'app' regular
sector news and a diary of events - not just Costain events but
commentary on developments such as the Government White Paper on
energy or announcements on the National Infrastructure Plan.</p>

<p>"We feel this is a more immediate way of communicating to our
stakeholders and the world at large. News and views on the various
sectors in which Costain works will be updated weekly."</p>

<p>"It's a communication tool for external contacts," adds Systems
and Technology Director, Bill Price. "It gives the true breadth of
our services and expertise. It also allows us to communicate our
views on strategically important events affecting the
construction/engineering industry."</p>

<p>The app will also include videos and be updated automatically.
Available through the Apple Store, it is initially suitable only
for the iPad, but will be adapted to fit other platforms that will
include BlackBerry's equivalent device, which is due to appear
after Christmas and Price is looking at other potential
platforms.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[
<p>1 December 2010</p>

<p>As Graham Keegan settles into his new role as Costain Water
Sector Director, he does so with the benefit of having spent much
of his career 'on the other side of the fence', as a senior water
company executive.</p>

<p>The former Business Development Director of United Utilities can
call on years of experience of dealing with contractors such as
Costain - and thus knows what the Company has to do to win more
business.</p>

<p>An increase on maintenance activities, energy-saving designs,
minimising carbon footprints and greater concern for ecological
aspects of projects will all have to be incorporated into future
water sector bids, says Keegan, who believes it will change the
sector appreciably.</p>

<p>That sector has come through the Government's recent
Comprehensive Spending Review virtually unscathed, with the
£21billion capital programme for the next five-year cycle intact.
However OFWAT are maintaining their demands for increased
efficiencies and are asking for contractors to deliver 'more for
less'. A large part of the water companies' capital spend for 2010
to 2015 has already been allocated through frameworks, with Costain
having had great success at Southern Water, United Utilities, Welsh
Water and Severn Trent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We've seen a lot of companies bidding extremely aggressively,"
says Keegan, in response to the OFWAT and water utilities
efficiency challenge.</p>

<p>"Our strategy is to offer innovation with delivery excellence
that emphasises safety and quality; a strategy which has already
made us very successful and promises to maintain our enviable
position&nbsp;in the water industry throughout AMP5 and
beyond."</p>

<p>The nature of water sector contracts is also changing. Previous
AMP cycles have focused on constructing new facilities that will
improve water quality. With most of these projects now complete,
the emphasis is moving steadily towards maintenance and this will
make up most of the £21billion being spent over the current
cycle.</p>

<p>He feels this will fit in with the 'Choosing Costain' strategy,
which calls for the Company increasingly to balance its traditional
construction activities with activities such as operation and
maintenance of utilities including waterworks.</p>

<p>This change in Costain's direction has yet to register fully
with clients in the sector, however. Although he says Costain has
"a genuinely good reputation in the water industry - it's seen to
be professional, forward-thinking and competent" - it is still
perceived as a construction company.</p>

<p>One of his priorities, therefore, will be to make both current
and potential customers aware that Costain has a greater spread of
capabilities than they may realise.</p>

<p>This is entirely 'do-able', he says, pointing to its success in
the highways maintenance field. Previously regarded as a
road-builder, it entered the road aftercare market and has gone
from a standing start to market leader within five years: "We've
shown that type of transformation is possible."</p>

<p>Allied to this, he foresees contractors such as Costain having
to invest in research and development (R&amp;D) to stay in the
water sector.</p>

<p>Drawing on his long experience in the business, he admits there
is currently a distinct lack of R&amp;D, "the major reason for that
being it's not a hi-tech industry.</p>

<p>"A lot of plants work on good old gravity and some basic, simple
biology. The industry has used low skill levels in operating its
plants. I think that will change because we will have to be smarter
in the way we optimise aspects such as flow power and chemicals.
Increasingly, you won't be able just to switch it on and leave
it.</p>

<p>"I can't see Government providing money for this. The water
companies need to invest and if contractors like Costain want to
sell a valuable product there's no reason why they shouldn't
undertake R&amp;D as well."</p>

<p>Costain, he believes, has a great opportunity to increase its
share of the water sector market if it continues its progress of
recent years.</p>

<p><br />
<br />
<em>Graham Keegan is a civil engineer by training, who began his
working life with Northwest Water and has spent much of his career
with the firm, now called United Utilities. He moved into the
process engineering side of the business to boost his career
prospects and has had spells with Bechtel (as a Project Manager)
and 4D, where he was latterly Chief Operating Officer. Before
joining Costain he was Business Development Director at United
Utilities.</em></p>

<p>The new Tesco store at Gerrards Cross has opened for its first
day of trading this week, marking the final milestone of this
challenging project.&nbsp; This is the first store to be built over
a railway in this unique land-reclamation scheme where Tesco lease
the air rights to the land from Network Rail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Customer feedback has been absolutely fantastic regarding the
quality of the building," says Tesco Corporate Affairs Manager,
Michael Kissman.&nbsp;&nbsp;What customers shopping here haven't
seen is the years of hard work and dedication by the Costain
team.&nbsp; This store will delight our customers."</p>

<p>The project hit the national headlines in June 2005 when a
section of the tunnel under construction over the operational
Chiltern Line collapsed.&nbsp; Taking over from the previous
contractor, Costain has led the reconstruction of the tunnel and
new store above.&nbsp; Works have been conducted over a fully
operational railway with no disruption to the network.</p>

<p>For two and a half years Costain worked with Scott Wilson to
review the scheme, developing a design solution and methodology
acceptable to Network Rail.&nbsp; The 22 month construction
programme that followed this has been completed ahead of programme
with over a million man-hours worked and no reportable
accidents.</p>

<p>The new tunnel is 319m long and reinstates the original ground
profile of a deep Victorian cutting, providing a new four acre
development site in the heart of Gerrards Cross.&nbsp; The project
was an engineering challenge even prior to the collapse, but the
problems faced by the Costain team to review and reconstruct the
structure were even greater.</p>

<p>The unique store building has been customised to provide a high
level of finish featuring enhanced oak features to the structure
and a large glass atrium.&nbsp; The front piazza area encompasses
cascading water fountains that showcase the quality of
specification and workmanship.&nbsp; A gas power station on site
simultaneously generates both electricity and useful heat, with
surplus electricity returned to the National Grid.</p>

<p>Martin Baughurst, Costain's Project Director, comments: "This
has been a hugely challenging project that demonstrates Costain's
ability to deliver a very technical project under high levels of
examination.&nbsp; The team has worked hard to engage with the
local community to minimise the impact of our works."</p>

<p>The Costain Group has made a key appointment as part of its
strategy to meet further the needs of the UK rail
industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gren Edwards, the Company's Rail Sector Director, wants to
broaden Costain's capability.&nbsp;The Company is already known in
the sector as a major project deliverer. Edwards wants to build on
that by adding new, specialist railway skills including track
electrification, signalling and specialised plant to turn it into a
multi-disciplinary organisation that can provide a turnkey service
for clients.</p>

<p>Acquisition may be one route.&nbsp; Costain's Board has made it
clear in the past that acquisitions in sectors in which the Group
aims to play a major role, such as rail, nuclear or water, are
possible to bolster the Company's position in the marketplace.</p>

<p>The potential prizes in transforming the market's perception of
Costain into a full-service rail contractor are considerable. Like
the water sector, rail emerged almost unscathed from the
Government's Comprehensive Spending Review. Not only does this mean
major projects such as Crossrail and Thameslink going ahead but
Network Rail can continue its 'enhancement programme' that aims to
remove bottlenecks on the country's rail system.</p>

<p>These enhancement projects may not attract as many headlines as
major schemes such as Crossrail and Thameslink, but they are vital
to unlock capacity on the network and account for more than
£1billion of contracts each year.</p>

<p>Additionally, says Edwards, London Underground (LU) and
overground rail networks remain a key prospect in coming years.
Considerable amounts of work will be available, not just in
construction but care and maintenance.</p>

<p>This is where Costain needs to position itself, he says, so it
can offer a complete portfolio of services that range from
consultancy work at the outset of contracts right through the
project construction phase and into care and maintenance
thereafter.</p>

<p>Edwards has considerable experience to handle Costain's
expansion in the sector. As former Chief Executive of Volker Rail,
a specialist rail contractor, he knows the types of skills that
will be required for Costain to break through into key stakeholder
status and tap into a steady stream of work. A geologist by
training, he also qualified in mining and quarrying engineering and
his previous posts have included metals exploration, operations
management in the extractive industries and managing British Steel
plants.</p>

<p>23 November 2010</p>

<p>Costain team members&nbsp;at the huge Felixstowe South
Reconfiguration project have seen their efforts&nbsp;take shape as
the project, to be known as Berths 8&amp;9, begins to resemble a
modern container terminal at the extended East Coast port.</p>

<p>Costain recently handed over the second phase of the project, a
300-metre stretch of quayside, adding to the 430-metre first phase
completed earlier this year. Around 50 per cent of the 'box storage
yard' that will eventually house the thousands of containers
entering and exiting the country, has also been handed over to
clients the Port of Felixstowe.</p>

<p>"The client is now commissioning his dockside cranes, which are
supplied under a separate contract and has also started to set up
his rubber-tyred gantry cranes which move containers within the
storage area," said Project Director, David Alefs.</p>

<p>"The storage area behind the quay is enormous," he added. It
will eventually stretch to 330,000m² and require 18 million paving
blocks for its surface.</p>

<p>Paving and drainage now forms the major focus of the team's
work, together with the creation of a new 'Out Gate' for the port,
a truck plaza where vehicles are checked before heading out on to
the national road network. The existing gate, which currently
serves both incoming and outgoing vehicles, will be converted to an
'In Gate'.</p>

<p>The remainder of the programme is on target to be handed over on
schedule next May.</p>

<p>Inside the port, meanwhile, the building that has been 'home' to
the Costain team for more than two years has been on the move.</p>

<p>As staff moved out to new offices, the question arose as to what
to do with the two-story semi-permanent structure, Curlew
House.</p>

<p>Initial plans to flatten it were considered, then rejected: "Why
demolish a perfectly good building?" said Simon Andrews, Systems,
QA and 3rd Party Liaison Manager.</p>

<p>In a simple cost-saving measure, the 250-tonne building was
instead progressively jacked 1400mm off the ground in a series of
lifts, allowing a pair of self-propelled hydraulic 20-axle trailers
to be guided into position underneath it.</p>

<p>The trailers (and building) were then remotely steered by a
handheld control unit some 400 metres across the site at an
impressive 5mph (the trailers can do double that speed if required)
and gently deposited on to new foundations next to the new quay
wall, ready for use by Port of Felixstowe staff.</p>

<p>22 November 2010</p>

<p>Costain has delivered a new state-of-the-art facility at
Gloucestershire Royal Hospital (GRH) which will bring a new level
of service to women and their babies from throughout
the&nbsp;Gloucestershire&nbsp;area.</p>

<p>The £27million Women's Centre started on site in February 2009
and was delivered six weeks ahead of schedule in October. The
three-storey building has been designed to provide facilities for
7,500 births annually and comprises the following
accommodation:</p>

<p>•&nbsp;12 Delivery Rooms<br />
•&nbsp;3 High Dependency Delivery Rooms<br />
•&nbsp;2 Obstetric Theatres<br />
•&nbsp;28 Cot Neo-Natal unit - which includes a 10 cot Neo-natal
Intensive Care Nursery<br />
•&nbsp;46 bed Ante/Post Natal ward<br />
•&nbsp;7 Midwifery Led rooms - which include 2 birthing pools<br />
•&nbsp;Gynecology &amp; Ante-Natal Outpatients Department</p>

<p>Costain Project Manager, John Simmons stated: "The new building
was constructed on the site of demolished hospital buildings within
the existing GRH grounds.&nbsp; As is often the case with hospital
sites the Costain project team had to work within a restricted area
taking care not to disrupt other hospital services."</p>

<p>This was the third project to be successfully completed by the
team for the Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. In
addition to the medical requirements, the Costain team had to
ensure that the building met tough energy efficiency
guidelines.</p>

<p>The Trust's Project Manager, Andrew Barron stated: "Due to
collaborative team working over £1.5million has been saved which
the Trust has been able to re-invest in other projects."</p>

<p>17 November 2010</p>

<p>Another major milestone has been achieved in the revitalisation
of Newbury in Berkshire with the topping-out of the tallest
commercial building at Parkway - the 475,000ft² development in the
heart of the town centre.</p>

<p>The scheme will contain 50 shops and kiosks, plus 774 car
parking spaces, when it opens in October 2011. There will also be
184 new homes, including affordable properties.</p>

<p>The opening came a step closer as Cllr Graham Pask, chairman of
West Berkshire District Council, wielded a ceremonial trowel to
complete the roof of the development's Block E. Block E will be
home to Debenhams, one of the major anchor tenants at Parkway.</p>

<p>"Debenhams is moving rapidly towards completion," said Project
Director, David Woodhouse. "The team has almost completed cladding
of the building and is only a few weeks away from finishing the
shell.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Immediately to the west of Block E, the ground floor envelope
for Block D is nearing completion and we've installed the
timber-framed residential units that sit above it," says Woodhouse.
Block C, which makes up the main entrance to the development, is
also significantly clad and residential fit-out has commenced.</p>

<p>"It remains a complicated, challenging but ultimately highly
rewarding project," he adds. "There are listed buildings, retained
facades and derelict buildings that we have to refurbish."</p>

<p>The project is being developed by clients Standard Life
Investments. When complete it will create an exciting new
shopping-led mixed-use scheme in the centre of the historic west
Berkshire market town.</p>

<p>16 November 2010</p>

<p>A significant milestone has been reached on the £300million
Cleaner Seas for Sussex scheme, being delivered on behalf of
Southern Water by Brighton and Hove 4Delivery Ltd, a Costain joint
venture.</p>

<p>'Alice', one of two 2.4 metre diameter&nbsp;tunnel boring
machines (TBMs), broke through at Marine Drive Pumping Station,
completing the first of three drives to link the existing Victorian
sewer system to a new Wastewater Treatment Works being constructed
at Peacehaven as part of the scheme.&nbsp; A total of 11 kilometres
of tunnels are being constructed through the chalk at between 8 and
42 metres underground.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Julian Smith, Southern Water's Project Manager, said: "'Alice'
has been working out-of-sight with our miners since June to assist
with the construction of the new sewer tunnel. Walking along the
tunnel she has created really gives you an idea of the sheer scale
of this project.</p>

<p>"A great cheer went up at the reception shaft when her teeth
appeared through the concrete wall. It was truly a celebratory
moment for the engineers, miners and the management team
alike."</p>

<p>School children from St Margaret's Primary School in Rottingdean
chose the name 'Alice', after 'Alice in Wonderland'. It is believed
that the inspiration for the story came from a tunnel linking a
garden to the seafront at Brighton. The children attended the
launch of the TBM at Ovingdean in June, when she started her 1700
metre journey to Marine Drive Pumping Station.</p>

<p>4Delivery Infrastructure Project Manager for the scheme, Craig
Reade, said: "This is a fantastic achievement by the team. The
first tunnel breakthrough is a significant milestone in this
complex project and I am pleased to share with our client the
recognition of the site team's hard work and effort since the start
of the project over a year ago."</p>

<p>'Alice' will now be returned to Ovingdean where she will be
re-launched in early December to construct a second 3.6 km tunnel
to Portobello Pumping Station. A second machine, 'Hollyblue', is
currently 1,500 metres into a 3,732 metre tunnel drive from the
treatment works site to Portobello Pumping Station, to complete the
connection between the existing sewer network and the new treatment
works.</p>

<p>Shortly before the breakthrough, Howard Goodbourn, interim CEO
of Southern Water, visited the tunnel drive. Howard has become a
regular visitor to the project since his appointment, and further
to a previous visit to the Wastewater Treatment Works he was keen
to witness the efforts being employed to deliver the significant
tunnelling works associated with the new scheme. Taking note of the
requirement not to adversely impact on production rates at this key
stage of the tunnelling works, Howard gave up his Saturday morning
to visit the tunnel during one of the planned maintenance shifts.
Commenting on his visit he stated that he was 'very impressed' with
the ongoing works, and that this latest visit reinforces his
positive view of the project.</p>

<p>The scheme is being built to treat the 95million litres of
wastewater generated each day by the residents of Peacehaven,
Telscombe Cliffs, Ovingdean, Rottingdean, Saltdean and Brighton and
Hove, so that this area meets the latest European environmental
standards on wastewater treatment.</p>

<p>9 November 2010</p>

<p>A-one+, the UK's leading highways maintenance provider, is not
only top of the league in terms of business won but has reinforced
its first-place ranking when it comes to ensuring the safety of its
staff.</p>

<p>The company, which combines Halcrow, Colas and Costain, took the
Sir Frank Davies Trophy at the annual health and safety awards run
by the Mineral Products Association (MPA) for its 'Look Up/Look
Out' safety campaign. This was designed to make staff aware of the
presence - and potential danger - of overhead power cables while
out on their duties.</p>

<p>As part of its submission for the category, A-one+ produced a
short video prepared by Halcrow's web and media team illustrating
some of the potential risks from overhead cables that its teams
could encounter.</p>

<p>The awards ceremony, which attracted an international audience
of some 350 people with industry professionals drawn from as far
away as South Africa, Malaysia, Australia and Hong Kong, was held
in London, with the prizes presented by Judith Hackitt, chairwoman
of the Health &amp; Safety Executive.</p>

<p>The seriousness with which the MPA takes the annual awards
ceremony was demonstrated by the fact that the judges decided not
to give an award in one category because they felt that none of the
short-listed entries had achieved a high enough standard to win the
award.</p>

<p>A-one+ is the UK's leading Managing Agent Contractor (MAC) on
four contracts handling maintenance on 32 per cent of the UK's
motorway and trunk road network - the maximum permitted market
share. It handles road management in four areas: East Midlands, the
Northwest, Yorkshire &amp; North Lincolnshire; and the
Northeast.</p>

<p>The organisation was also highly commended in the 'Bitumen,
asphalt, contract surfacing: Promoting safer behaviour'
category.</p>

<p>8 November 2010</p>

<p>Costain, one of the UK's leading construction and engineering
solutions providers, is issuing its Interim Management Statement
covering the period from 1 July 2010 to the current date.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>On 25 August, the Group reported a strong performance for the
first half of 2010 and that it had entered the second half of the
year with a good order book, robust finances and a net cash balance
in excess of £100 million.</p>

<p>Since then, the Group has delivered a strong operational and
financial performance in line with the Board's expectations.</p>

<p>Costain continues to benefit from its 'Choosing Costain'
strategy of focussing on targeted blue chip customers in chosen
sectors whose major spending plans are underpinned by strategic
national needs, regulatory commitments or essential maintenance
requirements.</p>

<p>The Group has a proven scale and capability to deliver
successfully complex solutions in markets with significant
potential including power, waste, rail and nuclear and will
continue to broaden its capability in providing a range of
lifecycle solutions to its customers.</p>

<p><strong>Order book</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since the half year, the Group has secured a number of
additional major contract awards and has a forward order book of
£2.4 billion.</p>

<p>The major contract awards since 30 June include:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">-&nbsp;Bond Street station upgrade,
in joint venture, for London Underground<br />
-&nbsp;Severn Trent facility at Frankley in addition to the AMP5
contract<br />
-&nbsp;A 10-year nuclear framework contract for Magnox
South&nbsp;<br />
-&nbsp;A cable tunnel contract for National Grid</p>

<p>As a consequence, the Group already has secured revenue of circa
£700 million for 2011.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the Group is currently preferred bidder on
contracts with an aggregate value of more than £400 million and the
level of tendering activity for the Group's target customers
remains very high.</p>

<p>The Group welcome the commitment by the Government in its recent
Comprehensive Spending Review, and endorsed in the National
Infrastructure Plan, to prioritise £200 billion of investment over
the next five years in key energy and infrastructure projects, such
as Crossrail.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Pension</strong></p>

<p>The Board has agreed with the Trustee of the Costain Pension
Scheme ('CPS') a transaction to reduce significantly the Group's
pension deficit by £22.0 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This has been achieved by the transfer of the Group's interest
in a portfolio of six PFI investments into the CPS at an agreed
valuation of £22.0 million. This is higher than the estimated value
for these equity positions as at 30 June 2010, and represents an
effective discount rate below 7%.</p>

<p>The transaction also brings forward and realises the profit from
the sale of the six PFI investments.</p>

<p>As a result of the transaction, the accounting profit realised
on the transfer of the assets is £10.5 million.&nbsp; After
discounting for expected profit from PFI equity sales that would
ordinarily have taken place in 2010 and a consequential additional
accrual for potential share-based payments, it is expected that
Group profit before tax for the year will be increased by £7.5
million.</p>

<p>Furthermore, an agreement has now been finalised with the
Trustee of the CPS regarding the actuarial valuation as at 31 March
2010, and the associated deficit recovery plan. This agreement,
which incorporates the £22.0 million transfer of the PFI
investments, will result in a corresponding reduction in the
Group's future annual cash contributions into the CPS over a
thirty-nine month period starting with effect from 1 January
2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Financial position</strong></p>

<p>Costain has a strong cash position in excess of £100 million and
no significant borrowings. The further improvement of the Group's
future cash flows as a result of the PFI transfer will also
strengthen the Group's financial position going forward.</p>

<p><strong>Outlook</strong></p>

<p>Following the transaction to significantly reduce the pension
deficit, the Group's profit before tax for the year ended 31
December 2010 will benefit from an additional £7.5 million, as
indicated above.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whilst challenging market conditions are set to continue for the
foreseeable future, the Board expects to report continued progress
at the year-end in line with its expectations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<p>1.&nbsp;The six PFI assets transferred into the CPS are:</p>

<p>Prime Care Solutions (Kingston) Holdings Limited<br />
Arden Partnership (Derby) Holdings Limited<br />
Arden Partnership (Leicester) Holdings Limited<br />
Arden Partnership (Lincolnshire) Holdings Limited<br />
Integrated Bradford Holdco One Limited<br />
Lewisham Schools For The Future Holdings Limited</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;The gross asset value of the six PFI investments
transferred as at 30 June 2010 was £0.3 million (31 December 2009:
£1.5 million) after the IAS 39 mark-to-market swap adjustment and
£9.9 million (31 December 2009: £9.6 million) excluding this
adjustment.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;The profits attributable to the six PFI assets for the
six months to 30 June 2010 were £0.2 million (for the twelve months
to 31 December 2009: £0.7 million).</p>

<p>4.&nbsp;The IAS19 deficit in the 'CPS' as at 30th June 2010 was
£56.3 million net of deferred tax.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>NOTE: THERE WILL BE A CONFERENCE CALL FOR ANALYSTS AT 08.30
THIS MORNING.&nbsp; PLEASE CALL ADAM ALJEWICZ ON +44 20 7457 2020

<p>4 November 2010</p>

<p>Costain is approaching a critical Christmas milestone in helping
to upgrade one of London's major railway interchanges.</p>

<p>A Costain/Laing O'Rourke joint venture (JV) is working with
Network Rail on a £172 million major remodelling of Farringdon
station, the original terminal of the world's first underground
railway, the Metropolitan Line.</p>

<p>Both London Underground trains and national rail services pass
through the station, originally built in the 1860s.</p>

<p>The Government funded Thameslink programme, will mean longer and
more frequent trains between Bedford and Brighton and through the
centre of London. The first 12-carriage trains will begin operating
in December 2011 and will bring with them a substantial capacity
increase on the current eight-car configuration.</p>

<p>The Thameslink programme requires longer platforms at a number
of stations as well as other significant improvements to
Farringdon, Blackfriars and London Bridge.</p>

<p>Major improvements at Farringdon include the construction of a
new train shed roof, remodelling and updating the existing station
entrance, lifts that will provide step-free access to all
platforms, creating a new entrance and concourse (Turnmill Street)
and building a new 'Integrated Ticket Hall' (ITH) opposite the
existing station entrance. The ITH is so-called because it will
provide access not just to Thameslink services but also, future
east-west Crossrail services.</p>

<p>Cardinal House, a 12-storey 1960s office block which stood on
the site, has already been demolished and, where it stood, huge
double sleeved piles are being bored 40 metres down to create
foundations for the ITH. The JV, under Project Director, Keith
Morgan, is in full preparation for the major milestone of erecting
steel work for the ITH.&nbsp; "Although working at Christmas is a
challenge, the fact that there are no train services for several
days means that we can deliver the works more safely and more
efficiently than during the time provided by a normal, overnight
rail possession."</p>

<p>Both Tube and overground services at Farringdon will cease
between Christmas Eve and January 4, with a brief hiatus at New
Year when the Tube takes thousands of revellers home from
city-centre celebrations in the small hours.</p>

<p>"The site is extremely busy and due to its confined nature every
corner has an ongoing critical activity" says Construction
Director, Daniel Powrie, who recently re-located from the Church
Village Bypass project in South Wales. "Because so much work can
only take place when train services are not operating, the site is
always just as busy at night and weekends as in the day.&nbsp; This
provides a whole raft of different challenges than those found on a
highway in South Wales - but the team here is extremely
knowledgeable, enthusiastic and they are all going the extra mile
to ensure the Christmas milestones are achieved"</p>

<p>"Over Christmas we'll be erecting steelwork for the train shed
roof extension and the ITH," says Powrie. "We'll have 40 metre
steel beams coming in and it's fundamental that this work gets
done."</p>

<p>Even getting material from road level down to the worksite has
involved constructing a 90 metre, £500,000 concrete vehicle ramp
and a mechanical turntable because there is not the space for
vehicles to turn around.</p>

<p>As well as being extremely technically challenging, the
Farringdon project also involves greater-than-normal logistical
challenges. These include securing the consent for alterations to a
Grade II listed building, as well as the significant approval
process required when working adjacent to two live railway
lines.</p>

<p>At the heart of all of the joint venture's work at Farringdon is
the safety of the workforce and an extensive campaign is underway
to improve workers safety.</p>

<p><strong>Keeping neighbours and businesses happy</strong></p>

<p>For a business district, Farringdon has a surprisingly large
number of residents living in the area. Trying to minimise the
project's effect on them falls to Community Relations and Security
Manager, Gwyn Williams.</p>

<p><br />
"We've been here two years and we've only had about 100 complaints,
most of which have been minor" says Williams. "We don't want to
cause any, but bearing in mind the number of neighbours, I don't
think that's too bad."</p>

<p><br />
The project writes a monthly newsletter to residents, that gives
details of approaching work - and whether the work is likely to
generate significant noise or inconvenience. A quarterly community
forum, chaired by a local councillor, also gives householders an
opportunity to voice concerns and ask questions.</p>

<p><br />
"We mitigate noise as much as possible," says Williams. "For
example, we always get the operatives to work behind noise screens
when sawing, or to do it down in the basement of the station."</p>

<p><br />
The site sits at the boundary of three local authorities -
Islington, Camden and the City of London. "Most of the work is in
Islington and the relationship we have with them is excellent. An
environmental health officer comes down every two months and we
show him round and discuss the work being undertaken in the future;
noise mitigation and good communication with all stakeholders are
critical in ensuring this job is made as simple as possible"</p>

<p>26 October 2010</p>

<p>A&nbsp;Costain-Skanska joint venture has begun work on the
initial stage of creating the Crossrail rail route that will
eventually traverse London, with commencement of the project to
create the tunnel portal at Royal Oak, west of the city centre,
next to Paddington Station.</p>

<p>When complete in 2017, Crossrail will offer a new,
high-frequency rail route starting at Maidenhead in the west
through central London and out to the east, forking to Shenfield,
near Brentwood in Essex and to Abbey Wood in southeast London. The
central section through the capital will require the driving of
major new tunnels under the city.</p>

<p>When entering the tunnel, overground trains will start
descending several hundred yards before the portal. It is on this
gradient that the Costain-Skanska team at Royal Oak is now
working.</p>

<p>The initial stage is to create diaphragm walls on either side of
the route. This involves excavating a deep trenched panel followed
by creating the wall structure within it.</p>

<p>"The diaphragm wall is pretty much a huge retaining wall, around
200 metres long and around 27 metres deep at its maximum," explains
Project Manager, Dr Vicknayson Thevendran. Once the two diaphragm
walls on either side of the route are completed, bulk excavation
commences between them which is twenty metres wide over the length
of 200 metres. You then build a slab at the bottom of it and lay
the tracks on top."</p>

<p>The main problem facing the 100-strong team on the site is
extremely tight working conditions. One side of the site is just
three metres from the 630-volt live track for London Underground's
Hammersmith and City Line, while the other side is bounded by the
A40, a major road artery for Transport for London.</p>

<p>The proximity of other transport links creates complexities when
handling the inevitable paperwork, says Vicknayson. "We need to
submit every document to Crossrail, Network Rail, London
Underground and, on instances where we're close to the A40, we need
to liaise with Transport for London."</p>

<p>Work on the diaphragm walling began in late August and is
planned to be completed just before Christmas.</p>

<p>Costain has notched up another significant accolade from its
peers by winning the British Construction Industry Awards' 2010
prize for Best Practice.</p>

<p>The award went to the Bell Common Tunnel refurbishment project
on the northern stretch of the M25 London orbital motorway.
Upgrading the 500-metre-long tunnel for the Highways Agency was
technically complex and required innovative approaches to several
aspects of the job.</p>

<p>The judges remarked that the £90million refurbishment, which
began in October 2008 and was opened 11 weeks ahead of schedule in
March 2010, was "an outstanding team effort in which technical
ingenuity was applied to almost every aspect of a tricky
project".</p>

<p>The job was also highly commended in the Major Project
category.</p>

<p>Project Manager, Andy Firth, who attended the award ceremony at
the Grosvenor Hotel in London's Park Lane, said lateral thinking
was the key behind several aspects of the refurbishment.</p>

<p>The requirement to provide for a future increase in the number
of lanes in the tunnel, lead to the need to remove ventilation
equipment from the tunnel bores to increase the space available in
the tunnel for vehicles. The team used a Saccardo nozzle solution,
which involved building a large 'fan station' housing five very
large fans at one end of the tunnel, using a metal nozzle
to&nbsp;deliver the flow directly into the soffit of the tunnel and
blowing the air along its length.</p>

<p>The ventilation system prevents build-up of pollution during
periods of congestion and, importantly, in the event of a fire will
enable smoke to be kept clear of motorists evacuating the
tunnel.</p>

<p>Another technical innovation was used on the centre wall
dividing the two carriageways. This was initially planned to be
demolished and rebuilt. It was realised that this could cause
problems in the event of a fire, as the temporary lack of a central
wall would allow smoke to spread to both carriageways.</p>

<p>"After a number of trials and mock-ups we came up with the
solution of a hybrid wall that incorporated the existing structure
into the new one," explained Firth. "We had savings from the much
reduced temporary works, and the elimination of demolition and
waste production.&nbsp;This saved around £1million&nbsp;of direct
cost."</p>

<p>The BCIA prizes are just the latest in a series of awards
garnered by the project.</p>

<p>12 October 2010</p>

<p>Costain's *Geotechnical Services Division (GSD), is raising its
profile and geographical reach.</p>

<p>The Division plans to ensure that clients - both within Costain
and external third parties - know that its capabilities extend well
beyond the activities for which the GSD is best known.</p>

<p>GSD is based in the Buckinghamshire village of Bourne End, five
miles from the Group's Maidenhead HQ.&nbsp; Additionally, it
operates a geotechnical office in Allerton Bywater, West Yorkshire,
while it has recently opened another laboratory in Cheadle Hulme,
near Manchester to support several major projects including three
Managing Agent Contractor (MAC) contracts to oversee the upkeep of
roads and the Greater Manchester Waste construction phase. These 3
offices are able to manage any works across the UK.</p>

<p>Other GSD staff are constantly out on the road in vehicles
fitted with multiple testing equipment, or based at long term site
laboratories such as at Felixstowe, Church Village and
Peacehaven.</p>

<p>The Bourne End HQ has extensive laboratory facilities, primarily
involved in soil sample and materials testing.</p>

<p>"We handle any size of ground investigations from £500 to
£1.6million, undertake the sampling, the lab testing and produce
the reports," explains GSD General Manager, Phil Parsons. "We also
handle comprehensive materials testing, such as concrete and
aggregate but are constantly looking for new opportunities. We have
recently extended our capabilities into blacktop site and lab
testing as well as dust monitoring"</p>

<p>Besides these long-established skills, Costain's Environmental
Services Director, Andy Bull, feels the time is now right to ensure
both colleagues and external clients are aware that GSD can do much
more.</p>

<p>"Costain has grown a lot in recent years. Although GSD has grown
consistently over the last 10 years, it is quite small in Costain
terms and a lot of people genuinely don't know we exist." He
accepts that its reputation requires some burnishing: "Part of that
is getting people to try us and part of it is them knowing that we
do more than just testing things in the ground".</p>

<p>"We want to give a premier performance and part of that is
getting people to realise we're upping our game. GSD have adopted
an extensive programme of performance management and customer
feedback over the last 18 months and this has delivered consistent
improvement since its inception, recently ranking GSD within the
top 25% of suppliers within the Group's supply chain".</p>

<p>The environmental and ecological considerations that surround
projects today open up new opportunities for GSD, in areas such as
dust, noise and vibration monitoring, structural monitoring and
groundwater surveys.</p>

<p>And while GSD does have long-standing expertise in soils and
materials testing, associated skills possessed by staff mean that
it also has the capability of becoming more heavily involved in the
various MAC road maintenance contracts that Costain has picked up
in recent years.</p>

<p>Its new Cheadle Hulme laboratory has recently achieved the
United Kingdom Accreditation Service's stamp of approval for a wide
range of services. It intends to expand UKAS accreditation into
further MAC-related activities, including structural surveys and
pavement engineering. Bull says Costain would realise considerable
cost efficiencies if MAC teams used GSD for such work.</p>

<p>"There are some really knowledgeable people in the division,"
says Bull, "There's a lot of untapped expertise that we can share
around the Group."</p>

<p>Although most staff join GSD directly, one of Bull's objectives
is to encourage more people to transfer across from the main Group
structure, both to widen their knowledge base and also to bring
GSD's skills to a wider audience.</p>

<p>*(Costain Geotechnical Services provide a geotechnical and
geoenvironmental investigation service focused on high quality and
rapid response. Our resources are targeted at difficult
access/overwater/slope investigations combined with a high level of
engineering supervision. In addition we undertake both insitu and
laboratory testing of soil/concrete/aggregate using our UKAS
accredited laboratory.)</p>

<p>11 October 2010</p>

<p>Waste water treatment is flowing more smoothly in
Wigan&nbsp;thanks to&nbsp;a multi-award-winning facility that
Costain helped create.</p>

<p>United Utilities needed to replace its inlet works in the town
as the existing works had reached the end of its design life. It
had already started design work on the new plant when it called in
the IA+ joint venture (jv) that includes Costain to continue the
process.</p>

<p>The project, which was designed to have a throughput of up to
408 million litres a day, consisted of coarse and fine screens to
filter out debris, a high lift pumping station and grit
'detritors', which remove particles from the flow.</p>

<p>The jv developed a completely redesigned system that involved
relocating different plant from the type initially envisaged. In
doing so, they succeeded in reducing United Utilities' budgeted
£22.4million scheme to just £17.67million, saving in excess of
£10million on the original scheme (original scheme was estimated be
to in excess of £30million).&nbsp;</p>

<p>An early problem arose when the originally-allocated brownfield
site within the existing treatment works was no longer available.
This meant the team had to move to a small, triangular plot
adjacent to the existing inlet works. As an added challenge, the
new inlet works had to be built beside the operational site without
any disruption to its operations.</p>

<p>With the limited space available, the traditional cofferdam
approach to building the deep inlet pumping station was not viable.
A less obtrusive secant bored pile walling arrangement was adopted
instead.</p>

<p>The volume of concrete used on the project was also able to be
reduced by using polystyrene void formers, while the structure of
the high-level inlet screens plus the detritor structure was
simplified to ease construction, maximising efficiency and
cost-effectiveness.</p>

<p>The project has picked up a string of awards over the past year,
most recently winning the Capital Project Management Award from
<em>Utility Week</em>, repeating its 2009 success in this
contest.</p>

<p>The job was also highly commended in the 'Best Construction
Project 2009' prize from <em>Construction News</em> in the £10 -
£50million category.</p>

<p>5 October 2010</p>

<p>The latest school in Lewisham's Building Schools for the Future
(BSF) programme has passed a major milestone and is heading rapidly
towards completion.</p>

<p>Local council and church dignitaries were present for a
topping-out ceremony at Trinity School, a Church of England
secondary that will from next year be home to 600 pupils.</p>

<p>Costain staff under Project Manager Clive Kraus were on hand to
show Lewisham mayor Steve Bullock, local MP Heidi Alexander,
headmaster Father Richard Peers and the Bishop of Woolwich, the Rt
Rev Christopher Chessun, around the premises.</p>

<p>Stephen Wells, Group Strategy and Business Development Director,
says the Group was delighted by the £18 million-plus building,
which exceeded their expectations.</p>

<p>Trinity is the third of 11 schools being built in Lewisham by
Costain. The project team moved on site in June 2009 and work got
underway following the demolition of the former Northbrook School
that occupied the site.</p>

<p>As with many inner-city schools, the site footprint is tight and
little space is available for outdoor activities apart from a
multi-games unit. This has resulted in the most unusual aspect of
the new building, a second-floor open-air 'teaching deck' that can
be used for lessons in good weather and which also acts as a
recreational area for pupils during breaks.</p>

<p>"It's a paved area with glass balustrades and has a really nice
aspect over the adjacent Manor House Park," explains Kraus.</p>

<p>"Trinity is a PFI design and construction project. Over the
Christmas break we &nbsp;literally move all the equipment in from
the old school to which they have been decanted while construction
has been underway."</p>

<p>New furniture and IT equipment will be provided and installed,
ready for use. That process will take place in December and over
the Christmas break, with handover of the school due on 4 January
2011.</p>

<p>The end of 2010 will be a particularly busy period for the
Costain team working on the Lewisham BSF, with no fewer than five
further schools approaching Financial Close.</p>

<p>Costain's growing strength in mobile technology has been
acknowledged by an industry body charged with promoting the use of
the technology.</p>

<p>Construction Opportunities for Mobile IT (COMIT) has awarded
Costain its 2010 Commitment to Innovation award for its efforts in
applying mobile technology to improve efficiency and save costs on
its projects.</p>

<p>The award acknowledges Costain's position in the vanguard of the
construction industry in adopting mobile technology.</p>

<p>Among the Company's initiatives have been the use of Radio
Frequency Identification tags to track plant and equipment and
using electronic signatures on personal data assistants that allow
engineers to sign off satisfactorily completed sections of work,
rather than using paper documents. And vehicle-mounted equipment
incorporating a Global Positioning System is being used to carry
out topographic surveys of large areas faster and more safely than
the traditional method of someone working on foot.</p>

<p>COMIT consists of some 60-plus construction companies and
technology providers. It aims to promote the use of mobile
technology within the UK construction sector by spreading best
practice, promoting new developments and improving understanding
between both groups.</p>

<p>Companies such as Costain can detail technological problems they
face in their work and seek solutions from equipment vendor COMIT
members, explains Aalok Sonawala, Business Improvement and Systems
Manager on the Brighton and Hove wastewater treatment works
project, who received the COMIT award.</p>

<p>27 September 2010</p>

<p>Manchester has become the world's latest airport to accept the
Airbus A380 'super-jumbo' after a major development project that
saw Costain literally prepare the ground for its arrival.</p>

<p>Services to Manchester by Dubai-based Emirates airline using the
517-passenger double-deck giant began this month, making it one of
just 18 airports worldwide currently capable of accepting the
aircraft.</p>

<p>Costain began work in preparation for the arrival of A380
aircraft in May 2008 with the realignment and reconstruction of
taxiway routes. Work then continued with the construction of a
dedicated A380 parking stand, fully equipped to service the
aircraft whilst on the ground. All the pavements had to be designed
and constructed to accept the aircraft's size and weight - up to
560 tonnes with a full load of passengers, cargo and fuel.</p>

<p>Finally, Costain has just completed a three-month period of
night works across the airfield to widen access points to and from
the runway to accommodate the increased width required for the
aircraft to&nbsp;turn safely.</p>

<p>"We had to dig out the old apron and put in a new, deeper,
thicker stand," says Guy Wooley, Costain's Framework Manager at the
airport. "In terms of technical construction it was relatively
straightforward. What made it difficult was that it was all carried
out in the middle of a live airport. Logistically, things were a
lot more difficult, as there are always access and egress problems,
and the ever-present security issues."</p>

<p>Full service facilities to handle the aircraft also had to be
incorporated. The A380 aircraft is so large that a special docking
system had to be installed to give pilots the necessary guidance to
line up the aircraft with the specially-modified passenger pier.
The airport has also fitted a double-level air bridge to allow
faster passenger boarding and disembarkation.</p>

<p>Costain's preparatory work for the A380 stand was instrumental
in the Company receiving Manchester Airport's Contractor of the
Year award - no mean feat when one considers the number of
contractors employed by an airport of Manchester's size.</p>

<p>Manchester's 2010 Project Awards Ceremony, with guest speaker
Sir Michael Latham, Chairman of the Construction Industry training
Board, saw Costain receive Principal Contractor of the Year Award
and a Social Commitment of the Year Award. The Subcontractor of the
Year Award was won by a Costain subcontractor, Allied Drilling.</p>

<p><br />
•&nbsp;A Partnership Day saw members of the Costain team combine
recently with airport staff and members of the supply chain to give
a new lease of life to a community hall in Wythenshawe. Around 20
people of the Framework Team painted and generally refreshed the
facility to improve it for local residents.</p>

<p>22 September 2010</p>

<p>Costain is trialling new mobile technology systems that it hopes
will lead to greater accountability and financial savings on sites,
as well as enhancing the Company's brand with customers.</p>

<p>The system involves attaching radio frequency identification
(RFID) tags to equipment such as power tools in order to monitor
their usage. These tags can be read by software installed on
'intelligent phones' with e-mail capabilities or on personal data
assistants (PDAs).</p>

<p>Earlier uses of similar Global Positioning System technology on
road maintenance contracts have enabled staff to see instantly
which vehicle is closest to an incident that requires
attention.</p>

<p>RFID readers, when held close to a tool fitted with a tag, can
read information such as when the tool requires maintenance or
replacement of components.&nbsp; The tags also allow staff to
monitor who last used a particular tool, by noting when it was
logged out of the site stores, and by whom.</p>

<p>As a result, says Steve Hardcastle, a Graduate Safety Advisor on
the MAC 10 contract, "People are being more careful of equipment.
If it sustains a small piece of damage they are much keener to get
that reported." In this way, a small, relatively inexpensive fault
is prevented from deteriorating and requiring substantially more
expensive rectification later.</p>

<p>"We've compared three different road projects over a 12-month
period," says Hardcastle. "And on the face of it, the savings we
are looking at are quite significant. What we're seeing is greater
accountability for plant and equipment that's been signed out of
stores. It's bringing out a fairly strong level of cost savings on
damaged or lost equipment." On the Church Village Bypass project in
South Wales, for example, it has saved several hundred pounds a
month.</p>

<p>The hope is that use of the RFID system will also bolster the
Costain brand by demonstrating to existing and potential clients
the Group's commitment to minimising costs.</p>

<p>The trial is still ongoing. Against the savings seen so far has
to be set the cost of the RFID tags themselves plus the readers and
software necessary to read them. And to make the most of the
system, it must also be adopted by&nbsp;Costain's supply chain
members.</p>

<p>20 September 2010</p>

<p>Costain has racked up what it believes to be another 'first'
through achieving ISO 27001 status across the entire Group.</p>

<p>ISO 27001 specifies the requirements for establishing,
implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and
improving a documented Information Security Management System
within the context of an organisation's overall business risks.</p>

<p>Gaining the standard required months of work, says Tony Blanch,
Business Improvement Director.</p>

<p>However, that effort means that both Costain personnel and
clients can now be further assured that information held both
electronically and on paper is secure.</p>

<p>Systems and procedures are now in place to protect the business
against loss of information - either accidentally or through
attacks by computer viruses and other means - says Blanch.</p>

<p>"It gives customers additional assurance about the security of
any information they have given us, such as design information that
they would not want to get into the wrong hands."</p>

<p>A multi-stage process was needed to attain ISO 27001 status.</p>

<p>"We started 12 months ago and during autumn 2009 did a 'gap
analysis' where an external consultant came in to see what we
needed to do. We already had lots of management systems in place
that hold ISO standards, so we plugged any gaps and fitted into
existing Implementing Best Practice procedures as necessary."</p>

<p>Some staff members were trained to carry out internal audits,
then a 'mass awareness' exercise was rolled out across the business
to ensure everyone was aware of ways in which information could
leak from an organisation.</p>

<p>"It made us more aware of some of the things," says Blanch.
"We've tightened up on the company's Information Communications
Technology Acceptable Use Policy and what people can or can't use
their computers for, particularly private use in office time."
While Costain does not want to impose draconian restrictions on the
personal use of computers, it does want to make people think of the
potential risks of using unauthorised software, some external
websites and social networking sites, and the storage of
information on laptops and other portable devices, he adds.</p>

<p>While IT policies, procedures and controls are important, good
information security management also involves people's behaviours,
so a key aspect of the programme has been training for staff to
maintain the 'human firewall' element of the system.</p>

<p>In May the BSi conducted a two-day assessment to check the
Group's procedures complied with the ISO 27001 standards. This was
followed in August by the full-scale, seven-day assessment to check
staff were complying with these procedures.</p>

<p>The August assessment was exhaustive, with BSi personnel even
clambering into rubbish skips to check that disposed-of documents
had been correctly shredded. They also conducted more than 50
face-to-face interviews with personnel at seven office and project
site locations across the UK.</p>

<p>Getting Costain into shape for ISO 27001 took "an awful lot of
man-hours", says Blanch, but it has given the Group an enviable
status. "We can't find anybody else in the construction sector who
has got this." Some rivals have individual departments that have
gained the accolade, but as far as both the BSi and we know, no
company holds this across-the-board status.</p>

<p>15 September 2010</p>

<p>Costain is strengthening further its presence in the MEICA
(Mechanical Electrical Instrumentation Control and Automation)
sector, with more personnel being encouraged to gain chartered
status.</p>

<p>The move comes as part of the Company's strategy of fostering
closer links with the Institutions of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE)
and Engineering &amp; Technology (IET).</p>

<p>"There are lots of people who we've identified as members of
this MEICA community," says Matt Crabtree, Sector Director for
Water. "There are around 40 people who are&nbsp;going through the
process to become chartered IMechE or IET, or could be encouraged
to do so".</p>

<p>The latest staff to be congratulated on gaining IMechE chartered
status are Peter Coulter (Brighton and Hove wastewater treatment
works project), Matthew Carmichael (Energy &amp; Process,
Manchester) and Richard Crane (United Utilities framework
contract).</p>

<p>"These three guys are role models for the rest of the
community," says Crabtree.</p>

<p>Many of those who could potentially achieve chartered status are
in mid-career and for various reasons have not gone down this route
earlier in their working lives. Some years further down their
career path they have realised they need to improve their
qualifications.</p>

<p>"I became a chartered&nbsp;engineer quite late in my career,"
acknowledges Crabtree, "but it's a vital qualification for a senior
role".</p>

<p>Costain's professional development team will provide support for
anyone seeking to embark on the process, he adds. Contact Jeremy
Galpin or Lee Bateson.</p>

<p>Additional encouragement&nbsp;comes from&nbsp;a support network
of mid-career peers.</p>

<p>7 September 2010</p>

<p>The latest in a series of Costain road projects in South Wales
opens to the public today - two months ahead of schedule - when the
first vehicles roll along the Church Village Bypass.</p>

<p>The £90million project brings a major improvement to residents'
quality of life not only in Church Village but the nearby
settlements of Llantwit Fardre and Tonteg.</p>

<p>The existing A473 has become increasingly unsuited to coping
with modern conditions due to a combination of sub-standard
alignments plus numerous junctions. Plans to relieve the flow of
traffic through the villages - currently 20,000 vehicles daily -
have existed since the 1980s.</p>

<p>With Welsh First Minister, Carwyn Jones, and Rhondda Cynon Taf
Council leader, Cllr Russell Roberts, officially opening the 7km
route, this long-held ambition finally comes true.</p>

<p>It is estimated that the new bypass will reduce traffic along
the A473 by as much as 70%. Improved public safety and reduced
pollution will be additional benefits.</p>

<p>Local people have already had a taste of the new development, as
they celebrated the opening of a 'community route' for cyclists and
pedestrians that runs alongside the main road. Around 3,000 people
turned out on an August weekend for a charity walk along the bypass
- the first and probably only occasion on which they will have a
chance to stroll along the carriageway.</p>

<p>The new route partially follows the line of an old railway line
with substantial sections of the route constructed through three
significant landfill sites. Costain's early contractor involvement
in the project enabled the cost to be substantially reduced and an
estimated £40million saving were realised from the Value
Engineering phase.</p>

<p>Costain's plans also ensured the road would be safer to
construct and by changing the bridge construction to a pre-cast
system over 200,000 working at height man-hours were reduced from
the project.</p>

<p>"As part of the Value Engineering phase we reduced the highway
to a single carriageway, however, by maintaining the roundabouts
and approaches to a dual standard we did not affect the traffic
capacity by more than a couple of percent. We also saved
significant money and programme constraints by early utility design
liaison," says Project Manager, Daniel Powrie. Additionally,
several planned overbridges were eliminated by realignments of the
route and improving junctions.</p>

<p>The toughest aspects, he adds, included the environmental and
ecological constraints the Costain team had to negotiate. Various
protected species had to be re-sited or protected. One such
ecological measure was a series of three 'dormouse crossings'
consisting of enclosed wire mesh pipes strung high across the road
to allow the protected species to cross the highway safely - a
precaution that featured in the national press.</p>

<p>Other 'green' facets to the contract included re-using 300,000
old car tyres buried in a landfill site as retaining landscape
features and the reuse and recycling of 99.6% of excavated earth
and arisings realised from the site, thus saving innumerable truck
trips through the surrounding areas. Around 117,000 trees have been
planted as part of extensive landscaping and ecological
mitigation.</p>

<p>The most challenging aspects, according to the Work Manager, Ian
Williams, were the weather and the ground conditions. "We basically
lost October to December 2009 because it rained…and then it
snowed.</p>

<p>"We cut through the old landfill sites and had to cope with
areas of peat as well as pulverised fuel ash from the old Tonteg
power station," he adds. The ash would have proved an unsuitable
base for the new road and so tons of it were excavated and
relocated to areas away from the actual line of the road.</p>

<p>His main memory of the job, he says, will be "the great team and
the way we've worked together here." The team was concentrated in a
single area, so problems could be discussed and resolved swiftly.
To have finished the job two months early "is not bad at all, when
you consider the size of it and the weather we've had."</p>

<p>Costain's drive to maximise community involvement in the project
was considerable: "Over 70 long-term unemployed people were
employed on the scheme and over 75% of the subcontractors were
local," notes Powrie.</p>

<p>Rhondda Cynon Taf Council's Cabinet Member for Transport,
Customer Care and Emergency Planning, Cllr Andrew Morgan, adds:
"This is a major project which will bring much relief to the local
communities, provide a safer environment for those who will
continue to use the current A473 and help to sustain economic
development in Rhondda Cynon Taf.</p>

<p>"I would like to extend my congratulations to our contractor
Costain for delivering the project ahead of time and with minimum
disruption, notwithstanding the complexities of the project and
some adverse weather conditions during the construction
period."</p>

<p>One of London's most high profile projects has been completed 10
days ahead of schedule and after 650,000 man hours with no
accidents.</p>

<p>40 Gracechurch Street, a Costain project, involved constructing
a new 122,000 sq. ft. office block which replaced two demolished
banks. The structure incorporates the old sub-basement and goes up
nine floors above ground level.</p>

<p>The building sits in the heart of the City and now has a cleaned
and repaired facade and the north elevation, in Lombard Court, has
new Portland Stone pre-cast panels.</p>

<p>Mark Sowerby, Costain Project Manager, said: "Safety was our
number one priority on this project from day one. We used first
class sub-contractors and the Costain team possessed the premier
skills and commitment associated with the Company. The site is one
of London's busiest areas and that obviously presented challenges
in terms of completing a demanding construction schedule. But we
all performed and delivered the goods!"</p>

<p>31 August 2010</p>

<p>Brighton &amp; Hove 4Delivery Ltd*, a Costain joint venture
project, in partnership with its client Southern Water, has opened
a&nbsp;purpose-built training tunnel at&nbsp;the Lewes Training
Centre.</p>

<p>The training facility has been constructed to train locomotive
drivers working on the £300million Wastewater Treatment Works
scheme (WTW), where Costain Tunnelling&nbsp;is constructing over
11km of tunnels.</p>

<p>This is the first time a tunnelling company has built a training
facility for locomotive drivers in the UK, and although it will be
used&nbsp;for the Cleaner Seas for Sussex&nbsp;WTW project, it
may&nbsp;also be used as a testing facility for the soon to be
introduced Construction Plant Competence Scheme
(CPCS)&nbsp;Locomotive certification.</p>

<p>Russell Mason, a Costain Miner working on the scheme, was tasked
with the construction of the 100m training tunnel. Russell, who is
a member of the CPCS&nbsp;Technical Advisory Group for Locomotives
said: "This is an excellent training facility for our loco drivers,
they can learn, or practice their skills&nbsp;negotiating all types
of obstacles, crossing points and work in confined areas before
being introduced to the working environment".</p>

<p>Russell's&nbsp;work with the CPCS Technical Advisory Group has
enabled him to use his&nbsp;vast experience within the group and
also use his knowledge to setup this training facility. With the
view to the Lewes Training Centre being able to act as an
assessment centre for the CPCS certification. Chairman of Technical
Advisory Group for Locomotives,&nbsp;Steve Goodgroves, said: "This
is an excellent&nbsp;training facility and I take my hat off to
Russell and the team for their excellent work. I have no doubt that
the Costain loco drivers will be leading the field in loco
driving".</p>

<p>Costain Infrastructure Project Manager for the&nbsp;WTW project,
Craig Reade, said: "This is a great example of Costain and Southern
Water's forward planning and taking action now to address the
potential skills shortage in the tunnelling industry, along with
our continued emphasis on Health &amp; Safety training. This new
facility puts Costain in an advantageous position for delivering
the requirements for future projects, further reinforcing the
'Choosing Costain' strategy".</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>*Brighton &amp; Hove 4Delivery Ltd is a joint venture between
United Utilities, Costain and MWH, delivering a £300million
environmental improvement scheme on behalf of Southern Water to
bring cleaner seas to Sussex. To find out more about the scheme

<p>23 August 2010</p>

<p>Travellers passing through Gatwick Airport this summer are
enjoying easier transit between the airport's two terminals, with
completion of the new shuttle system between the buildings.</p>

<p>Costain handed over the new North Terminal Shuttle Station to
Gatwick CEO, Stuart Wingate and Projects Director, Ray Melee, this
summer.</p>

<p>The hand over of the new station came as the summer holiday
season at the airport was moving into top gear.&nbsp; It forms the
first stage of what will eventually be a £1billion development of
Gatwick, the world's busiest single-runway airport.</p>

<p>Renewing the station involved demolition of the existing
structure and construction of a new state-of-the-art interchange
building that provides passengers with a light and airy space in
which to move from train to terminal.</p>

<p>Due to a very challenging programme the last eight months of the
project required 24 hours a day, seven days a week working to bring
it in on schedule, said Costain Project Director, Brendan
Conlon.&nbsp; The whole Costain team, supply chain partners and the
client pulled together to make this project a success, he
added.</p>

<p>At the shuttle hand over, Costain's Managing Director,
Infrastructure, Darren James noted the complexity of a project:
"That involved us working without impacting on a fully operational
airport and included the erection of 900 tonnes of structural steel
and 5,000m² of an inflatable roof. In addition, 10 lifts, two
escalators and two, 75-metre inclined conveyors were
installed."</p>

<p>19 August 2010</p>

<p>As the Government increases its efforts to curb carbon emissions
from the power generation sector, Costain is aiming to win a stake
in the renewable energy market.</p>

<p>Offshore windfarms offer the prospect of more predictable and
consistent weather conditions than their onshore counterparts,
together with fewer problems in gaining planning permission.
However, constructing them in an offshore environment is more
technically challenging.</p>

<p>Costain has teamed up with Hochtief and Arup in a new
alliance.&nbsp;This will seek to design and&nbsp;build the offshore
installations that are anticipated to spring up over the next
decade.</p>

<p>These installations will, in a large proportion of the zones,
require large concrete&nbsp; structures, known as gravity base
foundations, sitting on the seabed and into which the wind turbines
can be attached. This is where Costain comes in, explains the
Director in charge of the Group's efforts in the sector, Colin
Duff.</p>

<p>Bidding concluded this year between various developers and
energy providers and the Crown Estates (which owns the rights to
the seabed around the UK) for 'Round 3' of the licences that will
allow companies access to the seabed to install the wind
turbines.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
"If everybody develops the sites they say they're going to - and
that depends on how far they take Round 3, what happens to other
forms of energy and our use of energy - the offshore market could
be worth £200billion by 2020. The foundation element of that is
£50billion," says Duff.</p>

<p>A gravity base foundation would be a flask-shaped concrete
structure 30-40 metres in diameter, 60-70 metres tall and weighing
around 6,000 tonnes.</p>

<p>Winning contracts: "Will come down to having an affordable,
deliverable solution," says Duff. "The most efficient way of
achieving this is by setting up a manufacturing facility to mass
produce the gravity base foundations."</p>

<p>To meet the aspirations of the government in terms of their
targets for renewable energy production - of which offshore wind is
a major part - the facility will have to be capable of producing a
unit every two to three days</p>

<p>The consortium is currently assessing suitable sites for port
facilities to produce the foundations. They would be constructed by
a slipforming process operating round the clock.</p>

<p>•&nbsp;A renewable energy conference in Liverpool at the end of
June saw the consortium&nbsp;making a presentation and taking a
stand in order to further develop its relationships with its
potential customers involved in Rounds 2 and 3 of the offshore
bidding process.&nbsp;In July the consortium, along with Martin
Land, Power Sector Director, gave a presentation at a
Costain-sponsored Renewables event in London, emphasising Costain's
capability to deliver multi-discipline projects for power
generation infrastructure.</p>

<p>Costain has been appointed by Lewisham Council to rebuild
Deptford Green School after financial close was reached on the
£28.6 million Building Schools for the Future ('BSF') project. The
school is to be delivered under the Private Finance Initiative by
Learning21, a consortium that includes Costain, Babcock
International and Building Schools for the Future Investments LLP.
Funding is to be provided by Aviva Commercial Finance Limited.</p>

<p>Thirteen hundred pupils, teachers and staff will move into their
new school in September 2012, and local residents and community
organisations will be able to access the brand new sports and
conference facilities outside normal school hours. This means that
the new building, like other schools in the borough, will become a
key resource for the local community.</p>

<p>This latest contract is an integral part of Lewisham Council's
Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme, which has already
delivered two new schools, has another school under construction
and a number of new and refurbished schools progressing towards
financial close.</p>

<p>Commenting on the award, <strong>Andrew Wyllie,</strong> the
<strong>Chief Executive of Costain,</strong> said:</p>

<p><strong><em>"We are delighted to be involved in this BSF
contract and our continued involvement with Lewisham Council which,
through our Local Education Partnership, aims to further improve
education provision in the Lewisham area."</em></strong></p>

    <description><![CDATA[
<p>12 August 2010</p>

<p>Costain's tradition of technical and engineering innovation has
been demonstrated again with four key patents having been granted
and applied for in the past year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They all feature novel process designs developed by Energy &amp;
Process division in Manchester for large-scale processing of
natural gas.</p>

<p>Raw natural gas requires processing to meet specifications,
whether for use as fuel or as a raw material for chemicals
manufacture. All four patents relate to the use of cryogenic
process technology, a particular strength of the Manchester
operation.</p>

<p>The first two patents relate to the removal of nitrogen from
natural gas. Nitrogen can naturally occur in natural gas, or be
present or as a result of nitrogen being injected into underground
reservoirs to maximise oil and gas production. As nitrogen is inert
and does not burn, if present in significant amounts (over
approximately 5%) it must be removed for the natural gas to be used
commercially as fuel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most cost-effective process technology to remove nitrogen
from natural gas is ultra-low temperature (cryogenic) distillation.
Costain has long experience in designing and building plants
worldwide using this technology. Adrian Finn, Manager of Technology
for Costain Energy &amp; Process, says the two new patents achieve
reduced power consumption whilst achieving very high recovery of
the valuable hydrocarbons. As well as increasing revenues, very
high recovery brings the benefit of lower atmospheric emissions of
methane (which has a powerful 'greenhouse gas' effect). Reduced
power consumption lowers plant capital and operating cost compared
to current process technology.</p>

<p>The second pair of patents confirms Costain's position at the
forefront of technology for tapping undeveloped, 'stranded'
offshore gas fields that are too far from shore for a&nbsp;
pipeline to be viable.</p>

<p>Natural gas from such fields can be monetised by the use of
floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) vessels, which carry their
own gas processing plant. Natural gas liquefaction is conventional
onshore; in winter 2009-10 nearly half of the natural gas used in
the UK was shipped in as LNG from Qatar, Egypt, Trinidad and
Malaysia. Offshore liquefaction is just emerging as a viable
commercial proposition.</p>

<p>Natural gas is processed to remove contaminants, then chilled to
approximately -155 deg. C so that it liquefies and can be
transported. The two patents both achieve higher LNG production
than conventional technology, with one being a modified method of
providing the necessary refrigeration and the other being a more
elegant way of meeting LNG specification.</p>

<p>At the scale of operation that all four patents relate to,
efficiency improvements that reduce power and energy consumption or
increase production "can make a difference of millions of pounds of
net revenue to the operator over the life of the plant", says
Finn.</p>

<p>Energy &amp; Process has a developing portfolio of patents and
Finn adds: "Costain can show leading-edge process technology, that
whilst developed from sophisticated process analysis and modelling
tools is based firmly on design and operational experience. We have
process technology for most aspects of natural gas processing,
whether nitrogen removal, gas liquefaction or extraction of natural
liquids as well as the processing, separation and purification of
gas on refineries, petrochemical plants and for carbon
dioxide."</p>

<p>Charles Sweeney, Managing Director for Energy &amp; Process,
adds: "The development of Intellectual Property (IP) and patents is
driven by the requirement to continuously reduce the cost and
improve performance of Costain's customer offerings. Our customers
are choosing Costain because we are making significant advances in
technology that provide an improved solution to solve the
customer's problem."</p>

<p>Costain announces that it has been awarded, in joint venture
with Laing O'Rourke, a £130 million construction contract to
redevelop the London Underground's Bond Street tube station in
central London. The total cost of redeveloping Bond Street Tube
station is in the region of £300 million.</p>

<p>The contract was awarded by Transport for London (TfL) and is
part of London Underground's Tube upgrade programme. The expanded
Tube station will join with the new Crossrail station at Bond
Street to form one overall station.</p>

<p>More than 155,000 passengers currently use Bond Street Tube
station every day, a figure that is expected to rise to over
225,000 with the arrival of Crossrail in 2017.</p>

<p>The work will focus on the north side of London's retail hub
Oxford Street to boost capacity and create step free access to the
station. Work is due to begin in the autumn.</p>

<p>Andrew Wyllie, the Chief Executive of Costain, said: "We are
delighted to have been awarded this contract in the heart of
central London, which further builds on the two recent contracts
with Crossrail and again demonstrates our skills and capabilities
in this area."</p>

<p>6 August 2010</p>

<p>One of the UK's top industry magazines has voted Costain Group
PLC the outstanding contractor of the decade.</p>

<p>The 'Contractor of the Decade' Award was announced this week by
New Civil Engineer at the magazine's annual awards. New Civil
Engineer stated: "In the late 1990s Costain was in a dire state -
close to financial collapse, it took three years of austere
stewardship from then chief executive John Armitt - the current
chairman of the Olympic Delivery Authority - to turn the company
around and then another 10 - under Stuart Doughty and his successor
Andrew Wyllie - to make it into the company it is today.</p>

<p>"And today it is very much a company on the up.</p>

<p>"In New Civil Engineer's 2001 Contractors File, the firm
(Costain) was placed thirteenth, with a civil engineering turnover
of £150 million. Since then it has risen steadily to fifth, with a
£791 million civils turnover this year - a 427% increase. This rise
is unmatched by any other firm in the upper echelons of the File.
Closest is Balfour Beatty - Britain's biggest contractor, and a
firm which also enjoyed a tremendously strong decade. But unlike
Costain, its growth was in part due to major acquisitions."</p>

<p>New Civil Engineer quoted Stephen Wells, Costain Group Strategy
and Business Development Director, as saying: "Our goal is to
attract, retain and develop the best people by providing a
challenging and stimulating working environment where people enjoy
their jobs, fulfil their potential and are recognised for their
efforts."</p>

<p>All the top names in the industry - Balfour Beatty, Carillion,
Sir Robert McAlpine etc - were in the running for the Award but as
New Civil Engineer stated: "For being a firm recovering from near
collapse to one with a bold strategy for the future, Costain is New
Civil Engineer's Contractor of the Decade."</p>

<p>A major project in northwest England where
Costain&nbsp;is&nbsp;Design and Construction Contractor
for&nbsp;Viridor Laing (Greater Manchester) Limited, has won
international recognition as the outstanding project of its
type.</p>

<p>The Greater Manchester Recycling and Waste&nbsp;Contract for
client Greater Manchester Waste Delivery Authority, will process
1.1 million tonnes of waste each year for 973,000 households and
will serve a population of 2.2 million people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Costain's contribution as a key member of the project team is
the construction of 43 waste facilities utilising 'state of the
art' technology spread over 27 sites and valued at £397million.</p>

<p>The project has been singled out by a distinguished panel of
international judges working with international accountancy firm
KPMG and <em>Infrastructure Journal</em> magazine as one of the top
100 infrastructure projects currently underway worldwide.</p>

<p>In their special <em>Infrastructure 100</em> published jointly
by the two organisations, the project - the largest municipal waste
contract in Western Europe - was named as the global winner of the
'Social Infrastructure - Other' category.</p>

<p>Among the glamorous projects&nbsp;Greater Manchester beat to
take the top slot were the building of the world's tallest
skyscraper in Dubai, retrofit of New York's iconic Empire State
Building and the creation of London's 2012 Olympic village.</p>

<p>While the plaudits were welcome, the award had potentially much
greater significance for Costain.</p>

<p>"It raises our profile and makes us the partner about whom a lot
of those global businesses will be saying: 'That's who we'd like to
work with'. There are a limited number of parties that have the
experience to develop and deliver technologies of this scale and
complexity, so having our profile up there gives us an edge over
our competitors," said Mark Huddart, Waste Sector Director.</p>

<p>"If you're in the global infrastructure market,
<em>Infrastructure Journal</em> is one of the premier publications.
This achievement puts us up there and in focus for international
players looking to work in the UK market," added Clive Marks, Group
Treasurer. "The accolade would also attract the attention of the
international banking community. It raises our credibility in the
finance markets."</p>

<p>A Private Finance Initiative contract, "It is the social impact
of such an impressive and innovative deal that made the
Infrastructure 100 judges single out Greater Manchester&nbsp;as the
global winner of this section," wrote Angus Leslie Melville, editor
of <em>Infrastructure Journal</em>.</p>

<p>29 July 2010</p>

<p>A&nbsp;trainee Quantity Surveyor with Costain has put in place a
valuable addition to the Company's knowledge base.</p>

<p>Adam Golden has created a database that identifies the key
representatives responsible for innovation in Costain's top 100
supply chain partners. This allows staff to search for external
expertise to help solve clients' problems.</p>

<p>Golden joined the Costain student sponsorship programme in 2007
from Northumbria University in Newcastle and is now finishing his
year in industry on the Greater Manchester Waste project.</p>

<p>To develop the database he created a questionnaire for supply
chain members, collated all the necessary data, then developed a
computer tool allowing the information to be viewed, filtered and
used within the Group. The information sits on iCosNet, the Group's
internal knowledge base.</p>

<p>During his final year, Adam intends to develop a dissertation on
his project. When complete, it will provide Costain with a greater
insight into the relationships with innovation that exist within
the supply chain. The intention is to refresh the data annually to
ensure the database is kept up-to-date.</p>

<p>"This initiative is another example of Costain's objective to
encourage open and honest relationships with its supply chain and
further demonstrates that Costain is fully committed to meeting
clients' needs through innovation," commented Greater Manchester
Waste Director, John Boyd.</p>

<p>Golden's work, done mainly in his own time over a four-month
period last year, so impressed the Chartered Institute of Building
(CIOB) that when he returns to university in October for his final
year of study he will do so with a £1,500 CIOB bursary.</p>

<p>Work is getting underway on a permanent flood barrier to protect
a water treatment works that serves hundreds of thousands of Severn
Trent Water customers in Gloucestershire, in the event of future
extreme weather.</p>

<p>In 2007, unprecedented flooding swamped the Mythe water
treatment works (WTW) in Tewkesbury, leaving some 350,000 people in
the region without clean water supplies for 17 days.</p>

<p>With climate change likely to make weather patterns more
unpredictable, Costain has been called in by Severn Trent Water to
help safeguard the Mythe plant.</p>

<p>The £5.5million permanent flood barrier project involves the
installation of&nbsp; a combination of above- and below-ground
sheet pile walls, a concrete gravity wall, earth embankments,
drainage ditches and dewatering boreholes.</p>

<p>The work itself is relatively straightforward, but Costain has
to take account of nearby structures. Concerns were raised that
vibrations for the sheet-piling could affect the nearby Grade
II-listed Thomas Telford Bridge and its toll booth.</p>

<p>Local residents were also worried that their homes might be
affected by the vibrations.</p>

<p>"We've done a survey of the area and are monitoring the bridge,"
says Matt Crabtree, Costain's Sector Director for Water
(South).</p>

<p>"We did some trial piling in June very close to the bridge and
measured the vibration, which turned out to be less than that
generated by trucks going past."</p>

<p>The flood defences around the Mythe WTW will vary in height
depending on the vulnerability of various areas of the perimeter.
At their highest they will be 1.5 - 2 metres high, with the
earthworks being landscaped to blend into the surrounding
countryside.</p>

<p>The improved defences are calculated to protect the WTW against
a 1 in 1000-year flooding event.</p>

<p>The project is due to be completed in spring 2011.</p>

<p>21 July 2010</p>

<p>The project team on one of Costain's Greater Manchester Waste
sites has taken a group of school pupils studying for a new diploma
under&nbsp;its wing.</p>

<p>Students from Hope Valley College in Derbyshire have been making
regular visits to Bredbury Parkway, one of the sites in the Greater
Manchester Waste contract, as part of their Diploma in Construction
and the Built Environment (CBE) course.</p>

<p>Costain's involvement with the pupils began when Project SHE
Manager, Des Roy, was attending an 'options evening' at Hope
Valley, where parents discuss with teachers which non-core subjects
their children will take between the ages of 14 and 16.</p>

<p>The CBE diploma, which was newly introduced last year, comprises
a number of construction-related subjects that are studied in the
classroom, with field visits used to give a practical element to
the course. Pupils who successfully complete it get the equivalent
of seven GCSEs. The syllabus covers every aspect of a project; from
inception to completion, involving the theory and practical aspects
of design, the construction process itself through to operation,
plus maintenance and facilities management thereafter.</p>

<p>"I spoke with the Course Leader running the diploma, introduced
myself, said it sounded very interesting and offered him any help
Costain could give in the delivery of the diploma," says Roy. "He
got in touch and we decided we could help by arranging regular site
visits for the students to offer a practical insight that would
help with the delivery of the diploma."</p>

<p>The result has been a series of monthly visits to Bredbury
Parkway by the 12 youngsters taking the diploma. "The visits are
aimed at informing the students, but it is also important to make
them enjoyable. We are, after all, trying to encourage the next
generation into our industry."</p>

<p>When they visit the site the students are kept busy with a full
programme including presentations from Costain and its design team,
site tours and completing learning outcome assignments based on the
visit and the information the team gives them to take away. The
youngsters are encouraged to participate in question-and-answer
sessions with the team which is usually "quite an interesting
session" says Roy.</p>

<p>"The site team at Bredbury Parkway has really taken to the kids
and a great relationship is developing. Bredbury is one of the last
sites to finish on the Greater Manchester Waste contract and
usefully spans the full length of the diploma, so the pupils will
be fortunate enough to see the project progress to completion.</p>

<p>"The feedback we get from the school is very, very positive; the
kids like coming and the visits do help with the teaching of the
course." The pupils will sit their final examinations for the
diploma next summer.</p>

<p>Costain has, in recognition of the work they are doing on the
Greater Manchester Waste Project, received from the Peak 11
Consortium the Employers Recognition Award; details of the diploma
and the Recognition Award can be found at <a

<p>20 July 2010</p>

<p>Costain MWH has achieved preferred bidder status on a potential
£15 million contract tendered by Severn Trent Water to construct a
new treated water pumping station at one of its major water
treatment works in Birmingham.</p>

<p>The award is the first competitively tendered contract by Severn
Trent Water in the south of its region during AMP5.</p>

<p>Frankley water treatment works supplies water to around 1.4
million people in Birmingham and the surrounding area, making it a
major piece of national infrastructure and a vital asset for Severn
Trent Water.</p>

<p>In addition to the new treated water pumping station, the scheme
also includes a new tank to replace the existing one that has
reached the end of its functional life, and potentially, an
additional new chlorine contact tank. This would help ensure
drinking water standards can continue to be met while enabling
existing chlorine contact tanks to be inspected and maintained.</p>

<p>The improvements will further increase the security and
reliability of water supplies to Severn Trent's customers, while
improving the overall operation and control of the treatment works.
The new pumping station will ensure routine inspections and
maintenance can be effectively carried out without interruptions to
customers' supplies.</p>

<p>Early works are planned from December 2010 with major
construction activities expected to be underway in the summer of
2011. The scheme is expected to take around two years to
complete.</p>

<p>"Costain clearly put a lot of time and effort into its tender
submission, and has deservedly won the opportunity to progress this
highly significant project," said Severn Trent's Jonathan Wagstaff,
programme manager for the project.</p>

<p>Costain's Water Sector Director, Matt Crabtree, said: 'This is
excellent news for us. The fact that Severn Trent has chosen to
entrust work on this critical asset to us is a testament to the
confidence it has quickly gained in Costain MWH's ability to
deliver.'</p>

<p>14 July 2010</p>

<p>The Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR) has named Costain
the winner of the Best Graduate Development title in its 2010
awards.</p>

<p>The latest award followed on from the AGR naming the Group top
of two sub-categories - strategic alignment and graduate inductions
- in the field earlier in the year. That was enough for Costain to
outpace seven major organisations including Barclays, Boots and
PriceWaterhouseCooper to the overall prize.</p>

<p>At the award ceremony, held at the Celtic Manor Resort in
Newport, Wales, the AGR's judges cited "impressive evidence of
professional development schemes for [Costain's] graduates, plus a
variety of tools to monitor and evaluate engagement and to aid
continuous development" as the reasons for their decision. The AGR
Awards, now in their 32nd year, recognise and reward graduate
recruiters for creative and innovative campaigns that attract the
best graduate talent to their organisations.</p>

<p>The award "is a huge opportunity to enhance the reputation and
brand of Costain in the graduate market", says Talent and Skills
Manager Jeremy Galpin.</p>

<p>Terry Sexton, Managing Director of Costain's training partners
Creative Edge Consultants, adds: "In the light of our new corporate
vision, 'Choosing Costain', if you're a graduate out there in the
construction industry and you're looking for development, you're
going to choose Costain. It's really good news."</p>

<p>Fittingly, the submission for the annual awards was put together
by a team from the 2020 Board, which identifies and develops future
business leaders from the graduate community.</p>

<p>Kris Ramsey, one of the team and a Graduate SHE Advisor, said a
six-strong team took two weeks to complete the submissions, which
focused on Costain's strategic alignment - demonstrating that
everyone in the company was pulling in the same direction - and the
quality and impact of Costain graduate induction courses.</p>

<p>12 July 2010</p>

<p>In a tough financial climate, UK councils want&nbsp;a 'more for
less' search for improvements.&nbsp; For contractors such as
Costain, with innovation to the fore, this is presenting
opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Area councils are currently&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;their
infrastructure budgets to save money. Traditionally, highways
maintenance contracts run for five years with options to extend and
the easy option for councils is simply to extend existing
arrangements, says Costain's new Highways Maintenance Services
Director, Chris Tyerman.</p>

<p>Now, however, they are responding to impending cuts in their
grants by going out to tender on these maintenance contracts, in
the search for cost-effective solutions to their funding problems,
through innovative delivery of their highways maintenance
services.</p>

<p>"There are very good prospects in this sector," says Chris, who
was previously Deputy Managing Director of Community. "The simple
fact is that once you've got an asset you have to maintain it and
to maintain it needs investment, good management and a good process
of risk and asset management."</p>

<p>His newly-created role takes account of two facts: that Costain
wants to push further into the £1billion annual highways
maintenance sector, which will require some dedicated resources;
plus the Group's existing workload in this field, which has reached
a critical mass and now needs someone to look after it.
Chris&nbsp;will take this piece of work off the desk of Highways
Sector Director, Tim Bowen.</p>

<p>"We already have three Managing Agent maintenance contracts with
one of our key Customers, the Highways Agency - MAC 7 in East
Midlands, MAC 10 in Greater Manchester, Merseyside&nbsp; and
Cheshire, MAC 12 covering Yorkshire and, from 1 July, MAC 14 for
Durham and Northumberland," says Chris. "I'm also responsible for
other capital works framework contracts such as East and
South-East, and the Midlands."</p>

<p>Just 12 months ago, he reckoned that two or three highways
maintenance contracts would come up for re-tender this year. Now,
it looks as though 15 to 25 will be up for grabs over the next 12
months as councils seek a better deal from suppliers to cope with
their financial constraints.</p>

<p>Costain will seriously consider around five of them, he
believes: "It's a great opportunity for us."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>8 July 2010</p>

<p>Two major Costain projects in Wales have achieved premier safety
status.</p>

<p>The Costain A40 Penblewin to Slebech Park Improvement (or
Robeston Wathen by-pass) has recently passed a safety milestone
-&nbsp; 500,000 hours without a reportable accident and a zero
Accident Frequency Rate.</p>

<p>The Early Contractor Involvement project for The Welsh Assembly
Government commenced on site in the heart of Pembrokeshire in
February 2009, with just under five kilometres of "2+1" carriageway
to construct, 1.5km of side roads, four bridges, two underpasses,
10km of drainage pipe, 5 water treatment ponds, 250,000 m3 of
material excavated and 8,000 trees and shrubs to plant.</p>

<p>With so many disciplines and a whole range of construction
elements the planning and implementation is critical to ensure a
safe and healthy environment for the Costain team, which averages a
total workforce of 130.</p>

<p>Costain Project Manager, Mark Young,&nbsp;said: "The
entire&nbsp;staff and supply chain had shown a dedication to the
safe delivery of the project from day one, and I am extremely proud
of the dedication of all contributors to this achievement. The
support of the Client and his Agent has also been key to this
achievement."</p>

<p>The Welsh Assembly Project Engineer, Martyn Leech, commented:
"Reaching half a million man-hours of site work without a
reportable accident is a significant achievement and is testament
to the importance given by Costain to the safety of their workforce
on site. The target now will be to maintain this throughout the
remainder of the contract."</p>

<p>The Costain team working on the Dwr Cymru Welsh Water (DCWW)
framework has won the prestigious 'Occupational Health and Safety
Excellence Award' at the 4th annual DCWW Health and Safety Awards
held in Swansea.</p>

<p>In addition to this award, Project Manager, Mark Jones, was
Commended in the award category 'Outstanding Individual
Contribution to Health and Safety'.</p>

<p>John Madden, Framework Director for Costain said: "The whole
Costain team in north Wales is delighted to receive these awards
from Welsh Water. They recognise the team's contribution to Welsh
Water's drive to improve Health and Safety standards. It is
particularly pleasing that at the end of AMP4, Costain has been
recognised as the winner of the much coveted Excellence Award."</p>

<p>The Excellence award was judged by an independent panel of
assessors who commented:</p>

<p>"This was a comprehensive and focused presentation which clearly
demonstrated Costain's commitment to the overall development of its
health &amp; safety management systems and resulting in
demonstrable improvement - there was a clear commitment to 'raise
the bar'. There was clear demonstration of leadership from the top
and evidence of focussed risk management initiatives relevant to
site challenges. These included initiatives such as health
promotion and safety critical medicals for selected high risk
operators, along with continued commitment to supervisor training
and behavioural safety initiatives. Additionally, the company has
innovatively undertaken a climate survey of its supply chain to
engage its sub contractors in the health and safety drive for
improvement."</p>

<p>Costain will receive a cheque for £2,500 from DCWW to be
presented to a charity or charities; Costain staff in north Wales
have been asked for suitable nominations.</p>

<p>7 July 2010</p>

<p>Costain's current work on the Evaporator-D plant at Sellafield
which is currently the largest nuclear construction project in the
UK gives the company a strong position to benefit from approaching
nuclear power plant construction contracts, believes its new
Nuclear Development Director.</p>

<p>"The prospects are very good. There will be up to 12 nuclear
reactors built in the next 10 years, a market that's worth around
£50billion," says Alistair Smith. My role is to help Costain win
some of the major opportunities in building these new nuclear power
stations."</p>

<p>Costain has formed a consortium, ConstructEnergy, with Sir
Robert McAlpine, Hochtief and Heitkamp to take advantage of the
potential opportunities in the nuclear new build sector. Costain
will bring its experience from its current nuclear construction
projects and its ongoing interests across the Power market.</p>

<p>Although the country's economic situation has led to the
Government cutting back on spending, Smith believes that the
nuclear reactor construction programme will go ahead, both because
nuclear power can be the cheapest form of generating low carbon
power and because the construction programme will require no
Government subsidies.</p>

<p>Additionally, with North Sea oil and gas in rapid decline and
many of the older generation of nuclear power station approaching
closure, new generating capacity is urgently needed. "Power
utilities know that they need to invest in a mix of power
generation technologies, including renewables, efficient gas power
plants and nuclear to provide the country with secure, low-carbon
and affordable electricity," Smith commented.</p>

<p>Smith, 50, who has recently joined Costain from consultancy
Parsons Brinckerhoff (PB), hopes to bring a lifetime's experience
in the nuclear sector to win work for Costain.</p>

<p>Before his five years with PB, where he was Director of Nuclear
services, he was with the National Nuclear Corporation (NNC) for 23
years. NNC was the organisation that designed and built the
previous generation of nuclear power plants. He is Chairman of the
Power Industries Division of the Institution of Mechanical
Engineers and holds the same position with the Industry Affairs
Group in the Nuclear Industry Association, which represents the
interests of industrial members in discussions with clients,
Government and regulatory bodies.</p>

<p>1 July 2010</p>

<p>Gatwick Airport, this week, hosted an official 'handover' event
to mark the completion of the new inter-terminal shuttle.</p>

<p>Bombardier Transportation Ltd, Costain Group and Vinci
Construction presented the keys to Gatwick's Stewart Wingate, Chief
Executive Officer and Ray Melee, Projects Director.</p>

<p>For Gatwick, this signifies the first major milestone in its
£1billion development programme that will modernise the airport and
provide a better experience for passengers at every step of their
journey.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The original inter-terminal shuttle at Gatwick was installed more
than 20 years ago and was removed from service in September last
year having completed more than two and half million
miles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With an investment of £43million, the project included the
installation of a completely new shuttle system, new shuttle cars,
refurbishment of the rubber track and transformation of the
terminal stations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new shuttle will speed up the passengers' journey, taking
under three minutes to travel between terminals. Further benefits
also include: extra seating; live journey information; greater
security with monitored onboard CCTV cameras and full access for
passengers with reduced mobility.</p>

<p>Gatwick's Director of Capital Projects, Ray Melee confirmed its
£1billion investment programme is a top priority for
Gatwick.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Delivering this significant project two months early, is a
reflection of how well the Gatwick team and our construction
partners worked together to make sure our passengers can enjoy a
great experience at the airport this summer.</p>

<p>"Airports are complex environments to work in, the shuttle had
to meet the challenges of maintaining the highest level of safety
at all times, while also minimising disruption to our passengers
journeys through Gatwick - I'm proud of what we have achieved,"
added Ray.</p>

<p>Costain Infrastructure Managing Director, Darren James said,
"Costain is delighted to be handing over the inter-terminal shuttle
and station as part of its North Terminal Interchange
project.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is a complex project, that involved us working without
impacting on a fully operational airport and included the erection
of 900 tonnes of structural steel and 5,000m2 of an inflatable
roof.&nbsp; In addition ten lifts, two escalators and two 75 metre
inclined conveyors." added Darren.</p>

<p>Costain, which will announce interim results for the six months
ended 30 June 2010 on Wednesday 25 August 2010, is issuing the
following trading update ahead of entering its Close Period.</p>

<p>Since the announcement of the Group's Interim Management
Statement on 6 May 2010, the Group has continued to perform in-line
with the Board's expectations.</p>

<p>Costain has again demonstrated its resilience in an uncertain
economic environment.</p>

<p>The Group's operations continue to benefit from its strategy to
focus on targeted blue chip customers whose major spending plans
are underpinned by strategic national needs, regulatory commitments
or essential maintenance requirements in chosen sectors. In this
regard, it is encouraging that the Government has recently
reiterated its commitment to maintain investment in key major
infrastructure schemes.</p>

<p>In line with its strategy, the Group has recently amalgamated
its Environment and Community activities into a single enlarged
division, which will focus on new opportunities particularly in the
water and waste markets and meeting the needs of their existing
long-term customer relationships. Its Infrastructure and Energy
&amp; Process divisions will continue to target opportunities in
their markets.</p>

<p>As a result of a number of significant new contract awards since
the beginning of the year, the Group has a forward order book of
£2.5 billion.&nbsp; Circa £1.0 billion of work has been secured for
2010. In addition, the Group has Preferred Bidder positions of over
£500 million.</p>

<p>The Group has maintained its strong net cash position of in
excess of £100 million, and has no significant borrowings.</p>

<p>The Group will today and tomorrow host a site visit for analysts
to its operations, which will include the major M1 Junction 10 - 13
managed motorway project, and the UK's largest waste to energy
plant being constructed at Belvedere.</p>

<p>No new material information will be disclosed and all
presentations will be posted on the Group's web site at <a

<p>28 June 2010</p>

<p>The team behind Europe's second-largest land drainage scheme is
tackling its final major challenge before completion of the
project.</p>

<p>Demolition of the old pumping station at St German's, near
King's Lynn in Norfolk, is starting now.</p>

<p>Its replacement, built for local flood defence and navigation
authority the Middle Level Commissioners, had four of its six pumps
fully commissioned at the end of March. All six together are
capable of pumping 100 tonnes of water every second during a 1 in
100 year rainfall event, key in preventing 70,000 hectares of
low-lying East Anglia from flooding.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, its 76-year-old predecessor is being stripped
internally before demolition of the main structure starts.</p>

<p>Among the items being saved from its interior is a rare Crossley
engine, a type of diesel, which is being gifted to the Anson Engine
Museum in Cheshire.</p>

<p>The old pumping station, which is constructed predominantly of
mass concrete and straddles a waterway, will be demolished by a
long-reach excavator tipped with a mechanical breaker specially
adapted to work underwater.</p>

<p>While demolition is underway, it will be vital to retain a clear
flow of water between the old and new pumping stations.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, work is proceeding on dismantling a series of
temporary coffer dam cells around the new station that had been
erected to allow construction of it to be undertaken within a
locally widened section of the discharge channel.</p>

<p>Three crawler cranes - one of 300 tonnes, the others 280,
serviced by two smaller vehicles - are now well into the programme
to remove the coffer dams. More than 500 piles in 16 cells have to
be removed.</p>

<p>Project Manager, Ritchie Burcombe, said there had been close
involvement with residents of nearby St Germans village over the
demolition. Not only is there some unavoidable noise, but removal
of a major building that was part of the village for 75 years has
led to heavy goods vehicle movements close to residents' homes.</p>

<p>To minimise waste, none of the excavated material created during
the construction phase of the project has been sent off-site.
Instead, it is being used to create landscaped bunds around the
location. "Ironically, Norfolk is getting some hills for the first
time!" joked Burcombe.</p>

<p>Target date for substantial completion of the project is
December, with Costain due to be off-site in March 2011.</p>

<p>Costain Abu Dhabi is pressing ahead with plans to win more
business through focusing on the refurbishment of giant oil storage
tanks in the desert emirate.</p>

<p>Home of the United Arab Emirates' federal capital, Abu Dhabi has
vast reserves of oil and Costain's activities focus on providing
services to the various operating companies that form the Abu Dhabi
National Oil Company (ADNOC).</p>

<p>Much of Costain's work is concentrated on Das Island in the
Arabian Gulf, around 150km off Abu Dhabi's coast. There, a team of
personnel under Costain Abu Dhabi's General Manager, Alastair
Smith, works to ensure that the process of refurbishment of the
tanks - typically up to 25 metres tall, 80 metres in diameter and
each holding up to half a million barrels of crude oil - progresses
smoothly.</p>

<p>"The tanks must be drained down, checked and have both their
shell and bottom plates repaired every few years." says Alastair.
"The tanks are located within vast hydrocarbon processing plants
and are connected to the rest of the facility by a mass of pipework
that has to be sealed off to allow work to begin."</p>

<p>The Costain team is close to completing a contract to refurbish
three of the vast tanks and the company is hopeful of winning
further contracts which it has recently bid.</p>

<p>Costain Abu Dhabi's projects are carried out year-round in
temperatures that can exceed 45 degrees Celsius in summer, and
continues to bring in a steady flow of contracts - £6m in the past
10 months.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[
<p>16 June 2010</p>

<p>The UK's biggest rail infrastructure project is stepping up a
gear. A Costain-Skanska joint venture has won the initial contracts
for&nbsp;two tunnel portals that will take the Crossrail railway
underneath London.</p>

<p>After years of planning, Crossrail is now underway. When
complete in 2017, it will offer a new, high-frequency rail route
starting at Maidenhead in the west through central London and out
to the east, forking to Shenfield, near Brentwood in Essex and to
Abbey Wood in southeast London.</p>

<p>It will add 10% to London's public transport capacity. Crossrail
will carry close to 75,000 passengers every hour, significantly
reducing journey times and providing quicker and easier
interchanges.</p>

<p>Last May a Costain-Skanska joint venture was selected as one of
several contractors for Crossrail's advance works civils framework
agreement, a four-year programme worth £100 million.</p>

<p>Now, the JV has won the contract to create the tunnel portal at
Royal Oak, just outside Paddington Station in west London. This
will be the transition ramp for Crossrail trains entering and
exiting the central London tunnels.</p>

<p>Costain-Skanska has also won the contract for the second portal
at Pudding Mill Lane, near the Stratford Olympic site.</p>

<p>A major challenge for the JV team will be working in close
proximity to existing, live LU and NR railway lines and the A40
Westway. "Royal Oak is incredibly cramped," notes Lee Davies,
Costain's Sector Director for Rail. "There's a lot of heavy
engineering to do in a small space, which will require careful
planning and sequencing and be constructed without any disruption
to the railway."</p>

<p>Work on both sites is already&nbsp;underway. Royal Oak is due to
be completed in June&nbsp;and Pudding Mill Lane in 2013.</p>

<p>The longer timescale for the second portal is necessitated by
waiting for other aspects of the project to catch up. "There's a
lot of works at the front end, then a period of relatively little
work where other works are undertaken. We then complete our
part."</p>

<p>Among the complications at the east London site is the diversion
of an 11 Kv underground electricity cable, diaphragm walls for the
tunnel and construction of the City Mill River Bridge adjacent to
Docklands Light Railway.</p>

<p>These advance works are just the start, however. "The main works
are an order of magnitude bigger," says Davies. For the civils
work, Costain and Skanska are teaming up with Bilfinger Berger,
Europe's leading tunnelling contractor. Davies hopes that Costain's
early involvement in the project will give it an edge when it comes
to bidding for the main works.</p>

<p>"Being involved in the advance works gives us&nbsp;an insight
into the client, his methods of procurement and, in a small way,
the challenges of the job," he says. Technical challenges for
whoever wins the main works, he adds, will include picking a route
through the sheer density of underground utilities criss-crossing
the capital and securing the necessary resources and skills for the
job. Pre-qualification work for stations and civils aspects of the
main project is underway.</p>

<p>Around £2 billion has already been spent on Crossrail, mainly on
design and land procurement. "It's at the position where it's gone
too far to be easily and sensibly cancelled," believes Davies.
"Having said that, we will always be tasked with demonstrating
value for money, affordability and a commitment to driving down
costs."</p>

<p>11 June 2010</p>

<p>Costain, one of London Gatwick Airport's two main construction
partners, has been highly praised by the Considerate Constructors
Scheme, following a recent audit.</p>

<p>Started in 1997, the scheme was established by members of the
industry to improve the image of construction. Membership of the
scheme is voluntary and all participating companies sign up to a
code of practice which includes being considerate on site and a
good neighbour.</p>

<p>Other measures include how contractors manage their
environmental impact, safety, site cleanliness and on-site
facilities for construction workers.</p>

<p>Costain was praised for its work in redeveloping the forecourt
interchange at North Terminal, and was awarded 'very good' site
status.</p>

<p>There was also recognition for the way Costain worked in
partnership with their stakeholders including London Gatwick, its
airlines and handling agents.</p>

<p>Commenting on the awards, Ray Melee, London Gatwick's Project
Director said:&nbsp; "As a major independent airport, we're
investing nearly one billion pounds to modernise Gatwick and
provide a better experience for our passengers. We will do this
with our business partners, safely and responsibly.</p>

<p>"I'm delighted that Taylor Woodrow (Gatwick's other construction
partner) and Costain have been recognised by the Considerate
Contractors scheme.&nbsp; To deliver major construction projects
without impacting the day-to-day operations of the busiest single
runway airport in the world is a major achievement."</p>

<p>Brendan Conlon, Project Director, Costain said: "Costain is
delighted to receive this rating which was the first assessment at
Gatwick under this scheme.</p>

<p>"The interchange project is particularly challenging due to its
location within the heart of the North Terminal. Work has been
carefully planned and managed to avoid impacting on those
organisations that work close to the construction site. The
positive assessment from the Considerate Constructors scheme is
testament to everyone's hard work."</p>

<p>8 June 2010</p>

<p>The Costain Group has achieved Gold standard in the field of
Corporate Responsibility (CR).</p>

<p>In this week's Financial Times Responsible Business Supplement,
it was announced that Costain had achieved a score of 93.1% - a
Gold banding in Business in the Community's (BITC) CR Index.</p>

<p>The BITC Index is the UK's leading voluntary benchmark of CR. It
helps companies to integrate and improve CR throughout their
operations by providing a systematic approach to managing,
measuring and reporting on business impacts in society and the
environment.</p>

<p>The Gold banding is awarded to companies which: "demonstrate
openness and transparency through effective public reporting of its
material, environmental and social issues, programmes and
performance. Gold companies also tend to expand and adapt their
risk management processes by incorporating relevant aspects of CR
risk and opportunity."</p>

<p>Stephen Wells, Costain Group Strategy and Business Development
Director, has executive responsibility for CR. He said: "This Index
includes many of our key customers such as EDF Energy, National
Grid, United Utilities, Severn Trent and Network Rail. Those
companies and many others understand how critical it is to have
credible and respected third party assessment of their CR
operation. BITC provides just that and we are delighted to have
achieved Gold.</p>

<p>"CR is of critical importance to Costain. It is at the core of
our culture, operations and overall performance. Everyone in
Costain has been committed to the CR cause and Catherine Warbrick,
our CR manager, has worked extremely hard to ensure we achieve our
targets. Now we must improve further this year."</p>

<p>7 June 2010</p>

<p>The Costain Group has made several key changes in line with its
recently announced strategy 'Choosing Costain'.</p>

<p>The Company is combining, with immediate effect, the existing
Environment and Community Divisions into a single enlarged Division
(click here to view the <a
href="/media/48840/structure_chart.pdf">structure
PDF</a>) which will focus on new opportunities particularly in the
water and waste markets and meeting the needs of the existing
long-term customer relationships.</p>

<p>Alan Kay, formerly Chief Operating Officer, will be Managing
Director of the new Division in addition to retaining his
responsibility for the Group-wide co-ordination of health and
safety initiatives, design management and engineering. David
Jenkins, previously Managing Director of Environment, is retiring
early due to ill health and Alex Vaughan, Community MD, now becomes
Corporate Development Director with responsibility for shaping and
growing the Group in line with the objectives set out in the
'Choosing Costain' strategy. Alex will play a key role in the
acquisition, disposal and allocation of resources in alignment with
'Choosing Costain'.</p>

<p>Andrew Wyllie, Costain Chief Executive, said: "'Choosing
Costain' is a strategy for further profitable growth based on our
established success and provides an ambitious vision for the&nbsp;
development of the Costain Group.</p>

<p>"Our vision is to be one of the UK's top solutions providers,
with the scale and resources to meet successfully the increasingly
complex and challenging needs of our major customers.</p>

<p>"Costain will continue to focus its efforts on customers with
major multi-billion pound strategic investment programmes which,
irrespective of economic environments, are core to the UK's
sustainable 'life support systems' and are therefore deemed
essential.</p>

<p>"Over the next decade, we believe that those programmes will be
primarily in three growth markets:-</p>

<ul>
<li>Infrastructure - particularly highways, rail and airports</li>

<li>Environment - particularly water and waste</li>

<li>Energy and Process - particularly nuclear, power, and
hydrocarbons &amp; chemicals</li>
</ul>

<p>"Our large customers are imposing increasingly strict criteria
in selecting their preferred contractors. In particular, customers
are looking for contractors capable of providing the full
'life-cycle' of services. This process is in turn creating
significant barriers to entry. In order to succeed, it is essential
that Costain has the scale and ability to deploy the resources
required by such customers.</p>

<p>"Consequently, Costain will look to build on its current
strengths - and broaden and improve the quality of earnings streams
- by accelerating the development of an integrated front-end
engineering consultancy, and care and maintenance operations to sit
either side of our proven strength in construction:</p>

<p><strong>Consulting</strong> - one of the fastest growing areas
of the Costain business<br />
<strong>Construction</strong> - strong market position with world
class expertise in delivering major complex&nbsp;projects<br />
<strong>Care</strong>&nbsp;- operations and maintenance, already
13% of our Group order book</p>

<p>"The 'Choosing Costain' strategy provides significant
opportunity for growth by developing our capability across the full
life-cycle of products for our customers. In addition, we are able
to deliver an over-arching solution through a concession or private
finance approach.</p>

<p>"Resources will always be targeted on those opportunities that
provide the greatest potential return at an acceptable risk
profile.</p>

<p>"In conclusion, I would like to thank David Jenkins for over 40
years of service to the business. We have, as a Company, achieved
much in recent times. Now these changes will ensure that we are
well positioned to capitalise on future opportunities and continue
our successful path."</p>

<p>A Costain-sponsored student has helped a team from Birmingham
University share first place in a national competition to find
solutions to a topical question faced by the power industry.</p>

<p>Adam Flory, 21, who is due to graduate in summer 2011 with a
Masters in civil engineering, receives annual sponsorship funding
from Costain and undertakes summer work placements with the
Group.</p>

<p>He was a member of a four-strong team that entered an RWE nPower
challenge to universities in which the power generator set the
question of how an organisation like it could deal with the effects
of climate change.</p>

<p>Adam's team put forward the idea of controlled, sacrificial
flooding of flat plains upstream from highly-populated areas to
protect homes and commercial premises, then running the water off
through turbines when the flooding danger had passed.</p>

<p>"We initially had to submit a 500-word synopsis of our scheme.
We were successful and chosen to go forward to the next round,
giving a six-minute presentation at Ferrybridge power station near
Leeds," says Adam. "We then had to give an eight-minute
presentation held at Wembley Stadium in front of senior nPower
board directors in the final."</p>

<p>An accompanying model of such a scheme, made out of the trusty
modelling standbys of chicken wire, paper and plaster of Paris,
then painted, attracted the attention of the judges, says Adam.</p>

<p>Each team member received a cheque for £1,250 and their
university department was also awarded £5,000. They are also due to
present their project to a selected audience at the House of
Commons on 23 June and receive a certificate from the Prime
Minister.</p>

<p>Five Costain sites have struck gold in this year's Considerate
Constructors Scheme (CCS) national awards.</p>

<p>The M27 J3-4 Widening, St German's Pumping Station, Lewisham
Schools, and the A34 Wolvercote Viaduct Replacement Scheme each won
a gold award. The Church Village Bypass won two, for construction
activities monitored in 2009 and 2010. In addition, five sites
earned silver awards and five earned bronze, making the 2010 CCS
award tally one of Costain's best yet.</p>

<p>The Costain sites were among the 580 winners selected from the
7600 sites signed up to the CCS. These sites are monitored against
a Code of Considerate Practice designed to encourage best practice
beyond statutory requirements. The Code requires contractors to be
considerate and good neighbours, as well as clean, respectful,
safe, responsible, accountable and environmentally conscious.</p>

<p>"The beauty of the CCS awards is that they are independently
assessed, which makes them a valuable benchmark," said Peter
Fisher, Health, Safety and Environment Director.</p>

<p>For Dan Powrie, Project Manager at Church Village Bypass, the
site's gold awards are also acknowledgement of the team's hard
work.</p>

<p>"These two prestigious awards recognise our efforts to minimise
disruption to the public, to reduce the impact of the project on
the environment and to support our workforce.&nbsp; We will
continue to put good public interface at the forefront of all our
efforts."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Added Peter: "Our success in this year's awards is recognition
of the hard work put in by all our site teams. And it's yet another
reason why clients should choose Costain. Well done everybody."</p>

    <description><![CDATA[
<p>1 June 2010</p>

<p>Costain is striking up a closer relationship with the
Institution of Mechanical Engineers (IMechE), as part of its
strategy to develop its Mechanical and Electrical (M&amp;E)
capabilities.</p>

<p>The move is driven by the increasing importance of M&amp;E in
providing solutions to Costain's customers. This is being seen in
all sectors as asset and infrastructure owners strive to get more
for less - be it a road using variable speed signs, water and waste
infrastructure adapting to new sustainability legislation, a school
meeting environmental requirements or better solutions in the power
and energy sectors.</p>

<p>Matt Crabtree, Sector Director for Water explains: "In water it
stems from our success in winning a series of contracts with water
utilities for the fifth of the sector's Asset Management Programmes
(AMP 5). The new AMP has an increased reliance on M&amp;E within
the business."</p>

<p>"Increasingly, our workload in the water sector has a strong
mechanical bias to it. As we go through the AMP process we're
finding a lot of the projects are smaller and more capital
maintenance-related and a lot of that maintenance tends to be
M&amp;E related".</p>

<p>"Historically we've been very much focused on civil engineering
and are now looking to strengthen our training and relationship
with the IMechE. We have accredited training schemes that have been
validated by the Institution and for the first time have mentors
for all our Mech Eng graduates."</p>

<p>The strengthened relationship will include Costain taking a
place on the Institution's employer panel. "A lot of its current
members are manufacturers and it is keen to get a representation
from infrastructure providers on the panel," explains Crabtree.</p>

<p>The Panel is being developed to create more employer engagement
with IMechE and to provide a business-focused contribution to the
Institution's strategy, policy and activities by considering key
issues. Costain now has the opportunity to contribute to that
debate.</p>

<p>In the near future Costain will be holding an IMechE membership
day for graduate engineers with a view to making them aware of the
benefits of joining the Institution, striving for chartered status
and thus improving the depth of skills within the Group, he
adds.</p>

<p>25 May 2010</p>

<p>The latest chapter in Costain's long-running relationship with
the Port of Felixstowe is now less than a year away from its
targeted completion, with the team behind the current Felixstowe
South Reconfiguration project aiming to bring it in on time despite
the past winter's abysmal weather.</p>

<p>The first phase - 440 metres of quay - has been completed and
handed over for delivery of the new quay cranes. The second
section, involving a 300-metre length, is now underway, together
with paving work inland.</p>

<p>The freezing winter weather presented a number of challenges in
the first phase due to the low temperatures affecting the laying of
the concrete sub-base, says Deputy Project Director Nigel Desert.
Although the team was able to claw back some of the deficit, losing
that amount of time close to the end of that section of the project
had an inevitable effect on handover schedules.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the aim is still to finish the second stretch of
quayside by 12 September and the overall project on time in May
2011.</p>

<p>The new quay wall consists of 2.56-metre diameter piles capped
with site-fabricated precast concrete units, the heaviest of which
weighs 90 tonnes.</p>

<p>The project requires huge amounts of fill; to date, more than 3
million m³ of material has been dredged from the seabed just
outside the port and from off Great Yarmouth.</p>

<p>As well as the quaysides themselves, which will offer deeper
berths for the largest container vessels, there is also a&nbsp;huge
expanse of container stacking areas to complete on the 35-hectare
site, requiring more than 18 million paving blocks.</p>

<p>A Costain-sponsored student has won a university award for her
role in helping provide a community centre in an impoverished West
African village.</p>

<p>Southampton University final year civil engineering and
architecture student Claire Gott and her friend, Emily Hill, set up
the charity organisation Cameroon Catalyst last autumn and are now
close to completing construction of an educational and medical
centre in the village of Bambouti.</p>

<p>Claire, Emily and a group of fellow engineering students are
within £6,000 of a £50,000 target to build the centre. After
linking up with Cameroon charity the Mosame Trust they employed a
variety of fund-raising events such as selling doughnuts,
organising football tournaments and seeking donations from firms
and family for the project.</p>

<p>Claire's efforts won her the 'best student-led community
volunteering project' in Southampton University's Excellence in
Volunteering Awards. The judges considered criteria such as the
amount of work contenders put into organising their projects and
how successful they had been.</p>

<p>"Emily and I wanted to do something to use our engineering
skills in our last year at university", explains Claire. "I'd done
a lot of charity work before, including helping refurbish an
orphanage in Tanzania.</p>

<p>"We started to look at countries and regions that weren't
getting much support and heard about the Mosame Trust through a
friend. Bambouti, a village of around 900 people, is where the
founder of the Mosame Trust grew up."</p>

<p>The centre will include a classroom, library and community hall
as well as medical facilities. Construction started in February and
is due to finish in June. The Cameroon government has agreed to
provide two teachers and a nurse for the new clinic.</p>

<p>"All 19 of us in the civil engineering group will be heading out
there in June to help with the completion," adds Claire, who is
waiting to discover to which Costain project she will be
assigned.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[
<p>19 May 2010</p>

<p>Costain has reached a major milestone in its work on the Tesco
Gerrards Cross tunnel project with completion of the reinforced
concrete over-build above the busy Chiltern Main Line railway
between London Marylebone and Birmingham Snow Hill.</p>

<p>A 30-metre stretch of the 320-metre long tunnel, which was
developed by Tesco to enable a new supermarket and car park to be
built atop it, collapsed in June 2005 as it was being constructed
by a previous contractor. In the subsequent proceedings Costain as
main contractor and engineering consultancy Scott Wilson as lead
designer were brought in to complete the project.</p>

<p>While Costain has kept - and replaced where necessary - the
original precast concrete tunnel arch units, it has effectively
used these as structurally redundant but permanent formwork, and
constructed a new, contiguous reinforced concrete arch above them.
Whereas the original opposed precast units met in the middle at a
pivoted crown joint, the new reinforced concrete arch is seamless,
adding greater strength to allow it to securely bear the weight of
the backfill that will be laid over it and on which the Tesco store
and car park will be constructed.</p>

<p>The works to backfill above the reinforced arch with a
combination of conventional aggregate and innovative, lightweight
foam concrete are due to be completed in July this year, with work
on the Tesco store itself starting immediately thereafter. The
store is due to be open for business, on programme, by the end of
2010.</p>

<p>"Obviously after the collapse, everyone had a heightened
awareness of the difficulty of this site," says
Project&nbsp;Manager Martin Baughurst. As a result, "the levels of
review are massive and to get everyone's buy-in took time".</p>

<p>The biggest challenge, he says, was to get Network Rail's
agreement that Costain could work above a live railway in standard
daylight hours, minimising the requirement for costly and
publically intrusive rail possession work.</p>

<p>To gain approval from Network Rail and reassure other
stakeholders, Costain commissioned and installed a pair of goliath
cranes specifically engineered for the job, allowing for the safe
and controlled transfer of materials and equipment.</p>

<p>This was necessary as there were stringent limits on the impact
loads that the precast concrete tunnel arch units could withstand
if a conventional crane accidentally dropped a load on them at
height.</p>

<p>With the concerted and determined effort of Costain and its
subcontractors, the project is anticipated to be completed on
schedule later this year.</p>

<p>The Costain team working on the AMP4 Welsh Water Framework has
won a prestigious national accolade for the considerate way that it
completed a £1million investment scheme in Colwyn Bay.</p>

<p>The site team won a Silver Award at the Considerate Constructors
Scheme 2010 National Site Awards for its work in the Victoria Park
area last summer. The Welsh Water scheme involved upsizing two
sections of combined sewer and installing associated connections to
alleviate the risk of internal flooding to local homes.</p>

<p>The Considerate Constructors Scheme is a national initiative
which was set up to recognise and reward examples of best practice
within the construction industry. Just over two percent of more
than 7000 eligible UK sites completed during 2009 received the 2010
Considerate Constructor Scheme National Silver Award.</p>

<p>The Costain construction site was particularly commended for its
exceptional achievements in the Environment, Neighbour, Respectful
and Responsible categories. The judges commended the team on their
'very high level of compliance in all aspects of the scheme'. They
stated 'It is clear the whole project team have a desire to achieve
high standards and have pushed new boundaries'.</p>

<p>John Madden, Framework Director for Costain said: "This is a
fantastic achievement for the whole team who have worked closely
with all stakeholders to ensure the project considered
sympathetically the needs of the workforce, the environment and the
project's neighbours."</p>

<p>Costain sustained its profile in the rapidly-developing market
for new-build nuclear power stations with its presence at a major
London conference on prospects for the sector.</p>

<p>The Group was a gold sponsor of the two-day event at the Queen
Elizabeth II Conference Centre, which attracted several of the
power generation companies planning to build new nuclear generating
plants, as well as representatives of the nuclear industry
regulators and the reactor vendors.</p>

<p>It was organised by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, the
Nuclear Institute and the Nuclear Industries Association.&nbsp; HRH
the Duke of York was in attendance.</p>

<p>Topics covered by speakers included issues such as global
opportunities for nuclear power, the supply chain and the skills
gap in the UK workforce: the UK has not built a new nuclear power
station for more than 15 years.</p>

<p>However, with a rapidly looming 'energy gap', caused partly by
old nuclear stations reaching the end of their working lives, a
fleet of around 10 new stations is being proposed by investors
within the regulatory framework set out by the government.</p>

<p>"It was very worthwhile," reports Brian Slaney, Business
Development Manager, Costain Nuclear. "It was a good opportunity to
update and network with others in the industry. A lot of joint
ventures (JVs) and consortia are being formed, so it was very
useful to keep abreast of developments."</p>

<p>Costain has formed two consortia to pursue nuclear new build
opportunities. The first is with Sir Robert McAlpine to form a
strong British 'brand' that will focus on the preliminary works,
which include earthworks, marine works and&nbsp;tunnelling.</p>

<p>This JV has been enhanced with the inclusion of Hochtief and
Heitkamp to focus on larger construction packages, which include
the nuclear &amp; turbine 'islands' of the stations, and the
balance of plant.</p>

<p>This enhanced JV has been branded Construct Energy and offers
more than 50 years of nuclear construction experience including
current builds at Flamanville in France and Olkiluoto in
Finland.</p>

three special educational needs (SEN) schools - Delius, Chellow and
Phoenix - plus a mainstream primary, Guardhouse, which is
co-located with Phoenix in Keighley.</p>

<p>The design and build contract was signed in November 2008.
Guardhouse accepted its first pupils in late February, with the
other three due to 'open for business' on April 26.</p>

<p>"They were all fairly simple and straightforward," says Project
Director, Charly Clark. Although all the sites were those of
existing schools, for once access was reasonable, particularly
Phoenix/Guardhouse, which was on a greenfield plot.</p>

<p>6 May 2010</p>

<p>Costain is issuing, ahead of its AGM to be held later today, an
Interim Management Statement covering the period from 1 January
2010 to the current date.</p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Following on from the excellent performance in 2009, the Group
has continued to perform well and in line with the Board's
expectations.</p>

<p>The Group's operations continue to benefit from its focus on
targeted blue chip customers whose major spending plans are
underpinned by strategic national priorities, regulatory
commitments or essential maintenance requirements in chosen
sectors.</p>

<p>The Group continues to demonstrate its resilience in a difficult
economic environment.</p>

<p>Building on our success and as announced in March, we are now
implementing the next stage of our strategy, 'Choosing Costain',
which will ensure that the Group enhances its position as one of
the leading players in the industry. This will expand further
Costain's market position across the design and engineering,
construction, and operations and maintenance spectrum. This is
designed to enhance and broaden the spread of business and earnings
profile over the medium-term.</p>

<p><strong>Order book</strong></p>

<p>As a result of a number of significant new contract awards since
the beginning of the year, the Group has maintained its order book
at the record year-end level of £2.6 billion. In addition, it has
preferred bidder positions of over £600 million, ahead of the level
at the end of 2009. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To date over £950 million of revenue has been secured for
2010.</p>

<p>Since we reported the Group's results in March, the level of
tendering activity has remained high in our targeted growth markets
of Infrastructure, Environment and Energy &amp; Process.</p>

<p><strong>Operations</strong></p>

<p>Our Infrastructure division, which focuses on the Group's
activities in the highways, rail and airports sectors, continues to
perform well. Since the beginning of the year, Costain, in joint
venture, has been awarded a five-year £115 million Managing Agent
Contractor ('MAC') contract to carry out routine operational and
maintenance services in Area 14, which covers the North-East of
England. This fourth MAC contract has helped to establish Costain
as a major player in the UK highways maintenance market.</p>

<p>The Group has also been appointed, in joint venture, as one of
the Delivery Partners to the Highways Agency's National Framework
Contract involving the delivery of up to £2 billion early schemes
in the Managed Motorway Programme.</p>

<p>Costain, in joint venture, has also been appointed to construct
the Royal Oak tunnel portal, part of the enabling works for the
important Crossrail project&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>In Environment, which includes the Group's activities in the
water, waste and marine sectors, Costain has secured a five-year
contract with Welsh Water for the next Asset Management period,
AMP5, which began in April 2010. This contract, in addition to
other AMP5 contracts previously secured, reinforces the Group's
position as one of the leading players in the UK water sector.</p>

<p>Work continues on a £397 million four-year contract to deliver
part of the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority's (GMWDA's)
PFI Waste and Recycling Contract, the largest municipal waste
contract in Western Europe. We are currently pursuing, in joint
venture, a number of waste PFI opportunities.</p>

<p>The Energy and Process division, which focuses on the Group's
activities in nuclear, power and hydrocarbons &amp; energy,
continues to perform as expected and offers significant opportunity
for future growth. Work is progressing to programme on the major
Evaporator D nuclear project at Sellafield.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Spain, market conditions remain challenging. No land sales
are anticipated in 2010 and actions have been taken to reduce
costs. The 600-berth yacht marina, adjacent to the Spanish border
with Gibraltar, is close to completion and will become operational
in the summer. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Community division, which includes the Group's activities in
the health, education and retail sectors is, as previously
reported, being scaled down as we focus on more attractive
opportunities. The division is trading in line with our
expectations.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Position</strong></p>

<p>There has been no material change in the financial status of the
Group, which continues to have a strong cash position of in excess
of £100 million, and has no significant borrowings.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Outlook</strong></p>

<p>With trading in line with our expectations and an order book
maintained at the record year-end level, the Board is pleased with
the start to the current year.</p>

<p>The economic environment remains challenging but, with a strong
operational business and a strategy for the ongoing development of
the Group, the Board remains confident that the outcome for 2010
will be in line with its expectations.</p>

<p>Costain has harvested another heavy crop of awards from the
Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA)&nbsp;in the
organisation's latest annual awards.</p>

<p>The Group took no fewer than 35 gold and 12 silver awards for
its efforts to maintain safe working conditions - in offices as
well as on building sites.</p>

<p>"We've done well," said Group Safety, Health and Environmental
Director Peter Fisher. "It's another good result and demonstrates
the hard work the sites are putting in to try to constantly improve
the standards of safety. It's nice to have external acknowledgement
of the sites' efforts."</p>

<p>The top award, an Order of Distinction, went to COGAP for its
remarkable achievement in winning no fewer than 15 consecutive gold
awards.</p>

<p>COGAP also took a President's Award (a minimum of 10 consecutive
years of gold award-standard performances) for Costain Abu Dhabi,
while the division's DAS Island operations in the Gulf emirate took
a Gold Medal for five years' unblemished operations.</p>

<p>Other Gold Medals went to&nbsp;4Delivery, Leeds office,
Manchester office, Wales and West Region and Yorkshire Water.</p>

<p>While loathe to single out individual sites, Peter said that
some had picked up lesser awards but had achieved "fabulous
results" in doing so "in terms of the conditions they've had to
work in.</p>

<p>"Now we've set this as a benchmark, the challenge is to improve
further. The awards are nice but it's the actual performance on
site going forward that will be measured."</p>

<p>Costain Graduate Civil Engineer Steve Bodenham, currently
working on the 4Delivery Brighton &amp; Hove project (Costain joint
venture), is pushing for a place in the London 2012 Olympic
Games.</p>

<p>Steve has an impressive history with clay pigeon shooting.&nbsp;
His talent was noticed at an early age, gaining a place in the
Gloucestershire county squad at 14. He also received a Talented
Athlete Scholarship for his place at University, where he was able
to compete on the international stage and is now a regular member
of Team England.</p>

<p>Last season Steve was part of the victorious England team at the
home internationals tournament, and more recently has won the
national inter counties championship for Gloucestershire.&nbsp;
Steve has set his sights firmly on gaining a place in the GB squad
before August 2011 to qualify for a place on the Olympic team. With
another excellent victory&nbsp;recently winning a CPSA registration
event, hitting 199 clays out of 200, his chances look very
promising.</p>

<p>27 April 2010</p>

<p>Costain Civil Engineer Ruth Thompsett has responded to an appeal
by TV personality Professor Robert Winston to join a tough,
women-only cycling challenge in China to raise funds to improve the
health of women and babies.</p>

<p>More than 1,400 women from across the UK have already helped
Professor Winston raise over £2million for the Institute of
Obstetrics and Gynaecology Trust's Women for Women fund by taking
part in cycling challenges around the world.&nbsp; Previous
women-only rides have taken place in Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Cuba,
Turkey and India.&nbsp; This Morning television presenter Fern
Britten took part in rides in Egypt, India and Cuba and will be
cycling for Women for Women again in China in 2010.</p>

<p>Ruth, 29, is joining Women for Women Cycle China and will cycle
some 450km over five days through the countryside of China's
Beijing region, along rivers and through steep gorges, past tiny
villages, ancient tombs and historical landmarks.&nbsp; She will
experience a China that few westerners get to sample.&nbsp; As well
as training hard, she needs to raise a minimum of £3300 by 2nd July
2010 to fund groundbreaking medical research work at the Wolfson
and Weston Research Centre for Family Health in London, and she is
asking local people and companies to help her reach that
target.</p>

<p>Funds raised by Cycle China will support women scientists and
clinicians to specialise in research affecting women and babies,
empowering more women to lead in this field.&nbsp; They will work
in the research centre to improve prevention, diagnosis and
treatment of a range of devastating conditions which cause genetic
diseases, miscarriage, infertility, cancer and brain damage.&nbsp;
The fundamental aim is to improve women's health and to ensure that
more women have a normal pregnancy with a healthy baby.&nbsp; With
up to 250 babies dying every week in the UK from complications
during pregnancy, their work has never been so essential for women
and babies worldwide.</p>

<p>Women for Women is administered by the Institute of Obstetrics
and Gynaecology Trust and Professor Winston is Chairman of both the
Trust and Women for Women.</p>

<p>To pledge your support for Ruth, either post your sponsorship
donation, made payable to The Institute Trust Fund, to her at 12
Renown Way, Chineham, Basingstoke, Hampshire RG24 8XD or telephone
her on 07720 748 409.&nbsp; Alternatively sponsor her online at <a

    <description><![CDATA[<p>22 April 2010</p>
<p>Costain has won two national awards recognising the quality of its training and development schemes for graduate recruits.</p>
<p>The Association of Graduate Recruiters classed the Group as best in the fields of graduate induction and strategic alignment. The latter category requires a company to demonstrate that its graduate development is co-ordinated with the needs of the business.</p>
<p>Group Professional Development Manager Julia Calleja, together with colleague Kirsty Todd and external consultant Terry Sexton of Creative Edge Consulting pulled together Costain's entry, enlisting the help of 12 graduates from the Group's 2020 Board III who created a first draft within a week.</p>
<p>The task was ideal for Board members, who are often given projects that the business wants tackled but does not have the time to undertake. Handling the competition entry was "very directly linked between their own personal development and Costain's business development", says Julia.</p>
<p>Judges from organisations including Imperial College London, nPower and PriceWaterhouseCoopers placed Costain top of the Strategic Alignment category for several reasons, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>'clear and impressive evidence of professional development'; and</li>
<li>its application of a variety of tools to monitor and evaluate engagement to aid continuous improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the Graduate Induction category it cited:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thorough and well-presented evidence of the role of the induction within the business.</li>
<li>individual feedback from the assessment centre that helped guide the graduates and formed the start of their development.</li>
</ul>
<p>"These awards represent four years' hard work - I am delighted Costain is recognised as number one for graduate development," says Julia.</p>

<p>20 April 2010</p>

<p>Costain Energy &amp; Process is continuing to strengthen its
engineering capabilities in Abu Dhabi with the relocation of a Lead
Process Engineer from Manchester.</p>

<p>Costain has a well established, highly-regarded construction
operation in the oil-rich emirate, mainly based on Das Island.
Clients of Costain's Abu Dhabi-based operation (CADCO) have
requested that their corporate engineering capability is brought to
the local market. On the basis of CADCO winning an Engineering,
Procurement and Construction (EPC) type contract earlier last year
Engineering Manager, Steve Coulson, was assigned from Costain's
specialist oil and gas engineering office in Manchester to provide
leadership for this project and further develop CADCO's engineering
capability.</p>

<p>Recently, Lead Process Engineer David Wilkinson has been
assigned to the Gulf state, enabling Costain to execute high-value
concept and front end engineering design (FEED) projects from
Costain's Abu Dhabi office, thus further satisfying their clients'
request.</p>

<p>"Being based in Abu Dhabi enables direct communication with the
clients, which is required to ensure Costain clearly understands
the requirements needed to deliver high-quality concept and FEED
work" he says. "Additionally, my role is to support CADCO's
engineering manager in the preparation of bids and execution of
further EPC projects."</p>

<p>The short-term aim is to enhance CADCO's relationships with Abu
Dhabi's national oil company (ADNOC) by bringing Costain's gas
processing technologies to its facilities.</p>

<p>Longer-term, the aim is to widen this concept/FEED capability in
the Arabian Gulf in the six nations that make up the Gulf
Co-operation Council - Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates - of which Abu Dhabi is one.</p>

<p>David will provide support to Costain's Business Development
Manager, who regularly visits the region.</p>

<p>14 April 2010</p>

<p>Secondary school students in north Wales have benefited from a
presentation given by Costain employees on the Welsh Water
Framework which may help them to choose their future career.</p>

<p>Approximately 100 students at Castell Alun School in Hope
received an insight into what it takes to carve out a career in the
construction industry. During the talk they learnt about the
various roles and responsibilities which are needed to deliver a
large project such as the Penyffordd Habitats Scheme, which the
Company are currently undertaking in the area.</p>

<p>The existing Penyffordd Waste Water Treatment Works (WwTW) will
not meet stricter consent standards which come into force from
April 2010; and therefore flows will be transferred to the nearby
Hope works.&nbsp; The scheme involves conversion of the Penyffordd
WwTW into a pumping station, whilst retaining the site's storm
storage capacity. Over 3,500 metres of 250mm diameter rising main
is then being laid across agricultural land and along the highway -
as well as through Hope village. A number of external factors
influenced the development of the pipeline route; including railway
and river crossings, mitigation for great crested newts, badgers
and archaeological remains.</p>

<p>The students listened to presentations from various Costain
employees who explained why the scheme was taking place and the
role they played in getting the project from feasibility to
completion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Costain's Framework Director, John Madden, said: "The work at
Penyffordd and Hope is part of a large investment programme by
Welsh Water which will benefit customers and the local environment.
It is great that local students had an opportunity to discover what
the scheme entails and how this work will benefit the local
community whilst also showing the students the opportunities that
exist for them within the industry."</p>

<p>13 April 2010</p>

<p>An £80million scheme, delivered by Costain, to stop more than
800 West Ham homes flooding with sewage has been completed.</p>

<p>The three-year project, one of the largest sewer flooding
schemes Thames Water has ever carried out, includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>a new, two-mile sewer, 2.8 metres wide - one of the largest
sewers built in London - to carry away excess rainwater and sewage
during storms, preventing flows backing up into streets and
properties;</li>

<li>a new sewage pumping station at Abbey Mills in Stratford, east
London;</li>

<li>3.5 miles of new and larger sewers linking to the main sewer
tunnel.</li>
</ul>

<p>The two-mile sewer was dug by tunnel boring machine Theodora,
known locally as "Dora the Bora", who spent seven months munching
through 70,000 tonnes of earth 20 metres below the Jubilee Line,
Forest Gate, Woodgrange Road, West Ham Park, Vicarage Lane, Abbey
Road and over the channel tunnel rail link.</p>

<p>Lawrence Gosden, Head of Capital Delivery for Thames Water,
said:</p>

<p>"Protecting customers from the misery of sewer flooding is a top
priority for us. No-one should have to put up with this truly
horrible experience.</p>

<p>"Hundreds of homes in West Ham have been badly affected in the
past and I am extremely pleased that a long-term solution is now in
place to protect them.</p>

<p>"I would like to thank the local community for their cooperation
and patience during the works."</p>

<p>John Couch, Interim Deputy Divisional Director, Highways,
Transport and Parking for Newham Council, said:</p>

<p>"This scheme is very important for the borough as it will
provide long-term protection from flooding during times of heavy
rainfall for several hundred businesses and homes in West Ham."</p>

<p>The tunnelling machine was named Theodora by local schoolgirl
Eileen Edusah, after her mother.</p>

<p>12 April 2010</p>

<p>Church Village Bypass, a Costain project, has created an
impressive 70 new jobs for economically inactive individuals in the
county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf.</p>

<p>While many jobs have been lost during the recent economic
downturn, the Council's contractor Costain continues to fulfil its
contractual arrangements to employ 70 individuals during the course
of the contract.</p>

<p>In April 2008, the first person was employed and since then the
range of jobs filled have included engineer assistants, security
officers, land surveyor assistants, traffic management operatives,
forklift drivers, chefs and groundworkers.</p>

<p>In each case there is an intention to provide a minimum level of
training up to NVQ level 2 standard to ensure that at the end of
the contract each of the employees, if not retained by the host
employer, have the skills to seek and secure employment
elsewhere.</p>

<p>The type of training provided includes health and safety, CSCS
accreditation, first aid, computer skills and other professional
training associated with their role. In two cases the employees
have engaged with their new roles to the extent that they have
enrolled for degree courses in engineering and quantity
surveying.</p>

<p>One of those new jobs has been filled by Philip Johnson from
Cardiff, who joined Costain as a trainee quantity surveyor in
November 2008 and has worked exclusively on the £90million Church
Village Bypass project.</p>

<p>His duties in Costain involve measuring the costs associated
with design drawings, competitive tendering and sub-contract
management.</p>

<p>Philip explained: "Costain has funded me to start the Civil
Engineering Foundation Course for surveyors in conjunction with the
University of Glamorgan. I am also studying towards a Graduate
Diploma in Quantity Surveying at the University of West of England
(Bristol UWE).</p>

<p>"I will soon be working to secure a chartership and the support,
encouragement and opportunities afforded to me by Costain, thanks
to the Church Village Bypass project, have been superb."</p>

<p>Rhondda Cynon Taf Council's Cabinet Member for Transportation
and Customer Care, Cllr Andrew Morgan, said: "Church Village Bypass
is already having an immediate effect on unemployed individuals
throughout the county borough by creating 70 new posts.</p>

<p>"As part of our contractual agreements, we have ensured that
these job opportunities are made available, particularly during
this difficult time, and also support businesses throughout the
South Wales region by sourcing materials directly from them."</p>

<p>30 March 2010</p>

<p>Two years of planning came to fruition at the weekend, as the
Costain team on the Wolvercote viaduct project carried out one of
the largest bridge slides ever completed in the UK.</p>

<p>Over the course of 19 hours, eight huge hydraulic rams pushed a
5,000-tonne, 250-metre-long bridge deck 16 metres horizontally from
where it had been constructed on temporary piers alongside the A34
near Oxford, to become the new southbound carriageway of the
viaduct.</p>

<p>The new structure replaces its 1960s predecessor that had
suffered badly from water penetration. The Costain-built
replacement has been designed to have a 120-year lifespan.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
"It was a long weekend, but a fantastic achievement," says Project
Manager, Darren Dobson.</p>

<p>Proceedings began with the closure of the southbound carriageway
to traffic at 7pm on Saturday. The expansion joints and components
attaching the deck to its temporary piers were removed and the
entire deck lifted 20mm for the sideways slide.</p>

<p>"We slid it 16 metres to its new, online position and set it
back down on its new crossheads. It was a perfect fit" says
Dobson.</p>

<p>The expansion joints were reconnected, the bearings fixed and
the road was reopened to traffic at 3.15pm on Sunday. This was two
hours later than planned, due to the general complexity of the job
plus individual problems such as re-siting some of the hydraulic
rams and the failure of a power pack near the end of the
procedure.</p>

<p>Despite the overrun, "We only received two complaints and those
were massively outweighed by the congratulations from all
quarters," says Dobson. "I think everyone understands what we've
achieved in terms of construction techniques."</p>

<p>The temporary piers atop which the southbound deck was built
will now be demolished, the ground landscaped and the project
completed by June - three months ahead of schedule.</p>

<p>•&nbsp;The only known larger slide in the UK occurred in 1996
when a 5,500-tonne, 400-metre deck was moved. However, that
procedure took an entire 48 hours and involved a smaller distance
to slide.</p>

<p>Key issues facing the water industry and its consumers were the
intellectual fare at a 'discussion dinner' held by the Water
Related Livery Companies at London's Glaziers' Hall.</p>

<p>Declining global water resources, inadequate sanitation for
billions and energy usage by water companies in developed nations
were the topics under debate, attended by Costain in its capacity
as the UK's leading supplier of construction and maintenance
services to the water industry.</p>

<p>Leading the debate were Jonathon Porritt, well-known
environmentalist and now a non-executive director of Wessex Water;
and Ken Harvey, Chairman of Pennon Group, parent company of South
West Water and Viridor.</p>

<p>Costain's guest at the event was of particular interest to the
assembled guests, said Mike Sawyer, Head of the Group's Environment
division: Regina Finn, Chief Executive of UK water regulator OFWAT,
had recently delivered her Final Determination on the water
companies' charges for coming years. "A lot of the debate was
angled towards her, and she responded willingly and
authoritatively" commented Mike.</p>

<p>The event was valuable for Costain as it provided an insight
into the industry's thoughts on how it would be regulated and
managed in future, as well as discussions on how it could make
itself more carbon-efficient for the future.</p>

<p>BBC TV presenter Christine Bleakley may have fallen over eight
times and thought she had it tough when water-skiing across the
English Channel for charity&nbsp;recently. But she never had to
contend with having to leave the waterway due to a fire alarm.</p>

<p>That situation faced Manchester Project Manager, David
Richardson, while swimming 22 miles - equivalent to crossing the
Channel - in his local swimming pool as part of Costain Energy
&amp; Process's campaign to raise money for Breast Cancer Awareness
(BCA).</p>

<p>David, who had a close family member diagnosed with the disease
last year, began his personal fund-raising effort before&nbsp;he
learned Energy &amp; Process was supporting the 'Wear it Pink'
campaign.</p>

<p>Taking up a challenge advertised at his local sports centre, he
set off on 1,416 lengths of the 25-metre pool.</p>

<p>He initially intended to complete the distance over a 12-week
period, but improved his stamina so much that he was able to finish
it in less than&nbsp;seven. He faced some obstacles not normally
confronted by Channel crossers during his 15 hours of swimming,
including traffic jams of slow swimmers and 'dive-bombing'
youngsters. "There was even a fire alert that involved me having to
evacuate outside in my Speedos!"</p>

<p>David's efforts raised £1,400 in sponsorship - part of the
£3,500 raised by Energy &amp; Process. Events organised by the
Operations Admin team and held within Costain House included a
'Wear It Pink' day where staff raised&nbsp;£1,100 by dressing down
for the day (and were encouraged to wear pink to show support for
BCA). A competition for employees' children to design a suitable
t-shirt was won by Bethany Rothwell, 9, daughter of Planning
Engineer, Julie Rothwell. Costain Energy &amp; Process donated
£1,000 to make up the total.</p>

<p>•&nbsp;January's Haiti earthquake again brought Energy &amp;
Process's charitable nature to the forefront, with £1,500 being
raised by a dress-down day.</p>

<p>18 March 2010</p>

<p>The Welsh Assembly Government is supporting a campaign by the
Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to reduce slips, trips and falls
in the workplace, and has held up a flagship road scheme in
Pembrokeshire as an example of good practice.</p>

<p>During 2008-09, slip, trip and fall incidents in the workplace
resulted in 2,520 workers in Wales suffering major injuries or
injuries requiring more than three days off work, and construction
work carries some of the greatest risks. The "Shattered Lives"
campaign involves raising awareness of the impact of slips, trips
and falls in the workplace and direct people to the new Shattered
Lives website (<a
href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/shatteredlives">www.hse.gov.uk/shatteredlives</a>)
for practical advice and guidance.</p>

<p>Work is well underway on the A40 Penblewin to Slebech Park
improvement, and the principal contractor, Costain Ltd, has worked
with the Assembly Government to ensure that the site is kept in
good order and staff have all the right equipment to work safely at
height.</p>

<p>Project Manager for Costain Ltd, Mark Young, said:</p>

<p>"The new road will include a number of safety measures for
motorists, cyclists and pedestrians, so it makes perfect sense that
we maintain high safety standards during the construction phase
too.</p>

<p>"Building sites can be very dangerous places. Slip and trip
hazards include trailing cables, general building debris on the
ground and dusty, uneven floors. Working at height presents its own
hazards too, and using the right equipment could be the difference
between life and death.</p>

<p>"On a scheme of this scale it is essential to ensure that the
risks are identified and managed, which is why we provide rigorous
training for all staff and contractors."</p>

<p>Deputy First Minister, Ieuan Wyn Jones, said:</p>

<p>"I am delighted to be able to support HSE's campaign which
reinforces the pledge made by the Welsh Assembly Government last
year to support the HSE in promoting good health and safety amongst
businesses.</p>

<p>"The A40 improvement is one of our flagship schemes, and there
is a clear expectation on companies fulfilling these contracts to
be leaders in providing the safety working environment possible, as
Costain have done.</p>

<p>"The human cost of slips, trips and falls can be significant. In
Wales, there is also a cost to business and the economy in terms of
lost working days and putting things right when incidents do occur.
It is far better for companies to invest in safety measures
beforehand, than have to deal with the aftermath of a serious
incident."</p>

<p>Terry Rose, Director for HSE Wales, added:</p>

<p>"These figures highlight the very real and serious nature of
preventable slip, trip and fall incidents in the workplace.&nbsp;
Slips, trips and falls might sound funny but they shatter the lives
of thousands of British workers ever year."</p>

<p>In Wales during 2008-09, there were more than 880 major injuries
to workers, as well as 1,640 workers having to take over three days
off work. In Pembrokeshire, there were 56 major injuries and 53
injuries requiring more than three days off work reported in the
same period.</p>

<p>As well as the tragic human cost, preventable slips, trips and
falls are having a serious financial impact. HSE estimates that the
combined financial costs incurred by society as a whole is around
£800million a year, at a time when both businesses and individuals
are struggling financially during the current recession.</p>

<p>Costain sponsorship helped a team of student racers power their
way to the national finals of the Formula 1 (F1) in&nbsp;Schools
Technology Challenge.</p>

<p>The competition challenges students to design, build and race a
model F1 car made from a block of balsa wood and powered by a
compressed air canister. Points are awarded not only for design and
speed but also marketing and presentation.</p>

<p>The car designed by Stephanie Thompson, daughter of Costain's
James Thompson, Emma Banerjee, Hannah Ward and Zoe Irwin from West
Houghton High School, Bolton covered 20 metres in just 1.137
seconds to win the north west regional heat. At the national finals
held at the NEC, Birmingham, the car went even quicker, clocking
1.124 seconds to make it third fastest of the 30 competing cars and
only 0.011 seconds behind the fastest. The students, known as Team
Wipeout, were placed fourth overall.</p>

<p>Costain's sponsorship helped the team develop the car and buy
materials.</p>

<p>Proud dad James, Aftercare Manager on the Greater Manchester
Waste Project, (a Costain contract) says the students were:
"disappointed not to win but they know that it wasn't for want of
trying - they gave it their best.</p>

<p>And he says they will be back on the grid next year: "This
year's performance was a massive improvement on what they did last
year. Hopefully in next year's competition, with slight
improvements to the car, they'll be able to improve even more."</p>

<p>4 March 2010</p>

<p>Costain, one of the UK's leading engineering and construction
groups, has established a new North East operation for its Energy
&amp; Process business.</p>

<p>Costain's Teesside Operations is based in Stockton and is part
of its specialist Energy &amp; Process division. The new base on
Teesside forms part of Costain's strategy for growth.</p>

<p>The company has chosen the Tees Valley because of the region's
strong energy and process industry cluster, together with a pool of
highly skilled workers. These factors when combined present an
excellent opportunity for Costain in terms of the strategic
investment planned for the UK in these sectors.</p>

<p>Initially, the business will employ 30 people based in its
office on Preston Farm Industrial Estate, which will provide
engineering services for new facilities and revamps including
conceptual design studies, Front End Engineering Design (FEED) and
Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC). The new operation
will build on previous projects successfully executed by Costain in
the region.</p>

<p>Costain Energy &amp; Process also provides maintenance and
turnaround management and is committed to high quality services
incorporating the highest standards of safety, environmental
protection and performance.</p>

<p>The company specialises in three key sectors:<br />
•&nbsp;Hydrocarbons and chemicals; comprising upstream oil and gas,
refineries, petrochemicals and biofuels<br />
•&nbsp;Power generation; encompassing fossil fuels, renewables,
nuclear new build and carbon capture<br />
•&nbsp;Nuclear process plant; including decommissioning, fuel
reprocessing and waste reprocessing</p>

<p>Peter Laing, General Manager Teesside Operations at Costain
Energy &amp; Process said, "This investment demonstrates the
confidence Costain has in the North East of England and the
region's role in realising our growth plans for the Energy and
Process Division. We are one of the UK's leading companies with
significant resources to draw upon and we've chosen to invest in
the North East for good reasons, it has tremendous potential.</p>

<p>"Although the recent economic downturn has taken its toll on the
traditional industries in the Tees Valley, we're confident the
region will be at the forefront of the massive investment needed to
develop the new energy and process technologies that are required
to underpin the economic and environmental security of the UK. This
is an exciting time for the sector and organisations with long-term
vision can see real opportunities here in the years ahead.</p>

<p>"Costain selected the Tees Valley as the most attractive option
for its new operational centre, not just because of the established
process industry cluster but also because there is a large, highly
skilled workforce resident in the region.</p>

<p>"We will initially seek to employ 30 people at Stockton and have
ambitions to grow this number over the next couple of years."</p>

<p>Major construction work on a vital Costain joint venture scheme
to reduce congestion and improve safety on the M1 in Bedfordshire
was officially started this week by Transport Minister, Chris
Mole.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the Managed Motorways scheme is complete in spring 2013,
motorists travelling on a 15-mile stretch of one of England's
busiest motorways will be able to use the hard shoulder as a
traffic lane during busy periods - increasing capacity and
improving journey times.</p>

<p>The Transport Minister today witnessed the official start of
major construction of the scheme between junctions 10 (Luton) and
13 (Milton Keynes). Preparatory work started in August 2009 - six
months earlier than planned thanks to £16.6m of Government fiscal
stimulus funding.</p>

<p>Chris Mole said:</p>

<p>"The M1 in Bedfordshire is the first stretch of motorway outside
the West Midlands where we are introducing a Managed Motorways
scheme. This means the hard shoulder can be opened as a running
lane at busy times to ease&nbsp;congestion.</p>

<p>"The M1 is a key artery which impacts upon both national and
local economies, moving goods and people around the country, and
supporting investment. I am delighted that the proven benefits of
hard shoulder running are being brought to road users on this vital
national transport spine. This crucial scheme will make an
invaluable contribution to business and economy by increasing
capacity, improving journey time reliability and safety.</p>

<p>"This is part of the Government's commitment to delivering
innovative solutions to tackle congestion. Two Managed Motorways
schemes are already successfully operating on sections of the M6
and the M42 in the West Midlands. Results from the M42 pilot
demonstrate more reliable journey times for drivers and a reduction
in the number of accidents - and now users of the M1 in
Bedfordshire can look forward to these benefits."</p>

<p>1 March 2010</p>

<p>A Royal visit marked the formal opening of the Costain-built New
Johnson Community Hospital in Spalding, Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>The Princess Royal&nbsp;performed the honours for what Steve
Merrin, Costain Project Manager,&nbsp;describes as a "well over
due" facility for the area. It replaces the original Johnson
Hospital as well as the Welland and Holland Hospitals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new 8500m² hospital, set over two storeys, gives The Fens
town and the surrounding area a comprehensive range of medical
facilities, including a 32-bed in-patient ward, child, adolescent
and adult mental health units, x-ray department phlebotomy,
consulting / examination rooms, ambulance station and
administrative spaces.</p>

<p>In a pleasant departure from the norm, the site was not the
usual, tightly-constricted patch of ground. "It's a 10-acre
greenfield site on the outskirts of Spalding," says Steve. "It's a
nice plot, with plenty of parking space and reasonable access all
round."</p>

<p>Of course, with a semi-rural setting, you would expect to have
some rare species making an appearance, and you'd be right. Voles
had to be carefully cleared from inland drainage ditches that ran
along two sides of the site.</p>

<p>Apart from that, however, says Steve, the job was relatively
straightforward. The reinforced concrete and steel-framed building
with a variety of claddings to give visual appeal went up on
schedule in the 95-week, £24million project.</p>

<p>Initial opposition to the use of a greenfield site diminished as
the team involved local people in several users' groups. "It has
been an incredibly rewarding and enjoyable project to be involved
in," said Steve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>25 February 2010</p>

<p>Children at Telscombe Cliffs Community Primary School in Sussex
learnt about the dangers of playing near construction sites during
a talk by Southern Water's supplier *4Delivery, which is working on
a large construction project in the area.</p>

<p>4Delivery is carrying out the £300 million project to bring
cleaner seas to Sussex by building a new wastewater treatment works
and sludge recycling centre in Peacehaven along with an 11km sewer
tunnel between Brighton Marina and the new treatment works. The
work also includes building a new pumping station at Portobello
near Telscombe Cliffs.</p>

<p>During the health and safety talk at the school, 4Delivery
Community Liaison Manager James York explained the dangers of
playing near construction sites.</p>

<p>Head teacher, Gillian Webb, said: "We would like to thank
4Delivery for coming along to the school as part of our community
awareness programme and speaking to the pupils about the dangers of
playing on a construction site. Our pupils engaged positively in
the workshop and it has given them a good understanding about how
to keep safe."</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">4Delivery Project Manager, Craig
Reade, said: "Safety is our number one priority so when we are
working in the community it is essential that children are made
aware of the dangers of playing on and around construction sites.
We are always pleased to have the opportunity to talk to schools in
the areas where we're working."</p>

<p>4Delivery is a consortium comprising United Utilities, Costain
and MWH, and is&nbsp;carrying out a programme of environmental
improvement and water quality schemes for Southern Water until
2015. The improvements are taking place across Kent, Sussex,
Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, and include the £300 million
scheme to bring cleaner seas to Sussex. For more information go to

<p>Costain achieved another safety milestone recently by completing
three years without a reportable incident on the Dwr Cymru Welsh
Water AMP 4 Framework.</p>

<p>The Costain Health and Safety team, led by Ian Boam, run
numerous safety incentives alongside the supply chain that have
contributed to the increased safety awareness on Costain Dwr Cymru
Welsh Water sites.</p>

<p>John Madden, Costain Framework Director, said: "To have exceeded
1,770.824 man hours without a *RIDDOR since January 2007 is a
safety performance that the team can all feel very proud of. Safety
always has and always will be the number one priority for all
Costain Staff and supply chain. We will endeavour to continue this
excellent record as we strive to improve on our current standards
and practice."</p>

<p>The Framework intends to mark this achievement with a
celebration involving all staff from Costain and the supply chain
who have contributed to this success.</p>

<p>22 February 2010</p>

<p>In an increasingly 'green' world, waste is no longer a negative
commodity but a potential fuel and source of opportunity. An
opportunity that Costain can help the waste industry to
maximise.</p>

<p>That was the message given by Group Strategy and Business
Development Director, Stephen Wells, when he addressed
representatives from across the UK waste sector.</p>

<p>In a speech at the Institution of Civil Engineers to groups
including local authorities, regulators, equipment vendors,
consultants, competitors and major waste operators, Stephen noted
Costain's extensive experience in process plant design, management,
delivery and commissioning&nbsp;as well as Private Finance
Initiative (PFI) contracts.</p>

<p>Most major new waste plants are PFI projects, with contractors
providing local authorities with waste services for terms of up to
25 years.</p>

<p>"My presentation was on the value of the construction sector to
solving the UK's waste management problem," said Stephen. "It was
about how the UK construction sector can add much more value than
simply building these new plants.</p>

<p>"We're not just a Design &amp; Build entity, we're bidding
municipal waste schemes as a special purpose company and as someone
who can take on the maintenance side of the Operation &amp;
Maintenance of these facilities.</p>

<p>"Traditionally, waste operators have been landfill site
operators. We've been delivering PFI schemes across a variety of
sectors and customers for 15-20 years; we understand their
complexities and have delivered water and wastewater plants over
that period - indeed, we're the market leaders in those
sectors.</p>

<p>"We can help waste management landfill operators make the
transition to owning and operating complex Mechanical Biological
Treatment plants, which transform waste into fuel or compost. We
also understand the processes, risk and operational drivers for
maintaining these plants. We can add more value to the whole waste
spectrum."</p>

<p>Feedback to Stephen's presentation from the organisers of the
seminar had been positive, he said: "They said it went down very
well and they were pleased with Costain's contribution."</p>

<p>Costain Staff at the M53 Bidston Moss Viaduct Strengthening
Project have been digging deep in their pockets to raise over one
thousand pounds for their chosen local Charity - Claire House
Children's Hospice at Bebington, Wirral.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Charity is for children with life limiting, life threatening
conditions across Merseyside, Cheshire, North Wales and the Isle of
Man.</p>

<p>Funds have been raised by the site team at a number of site
social events including a raffle at the 'Greyhound Racing Night' to
celebrate the first 100,000 man hours worked without a reportable
accident.&nbsp; Prizes were donated by Denholm, Cleveland Bridge,
Concrete TS, BHL Electricals, Conemasters, BMSL and Costain.</p>

<p>The cheque was warmly received by Kirsty Wright and Claire the
Bear at a presentation at the Bidston Moss site. The M53 Bidston
Moss Viaduct Strengthening team will continue to support the
charity for the duration of the project (which is due to be
completed spring 2012) with further initiatives, including a visit
to the kids at the hospice by the site team who will be bringing
along a JCB.</p>

<p>Simon Ellison, Costain Project Manager, said: "The next major
safety milestone will be one million man hours without a lost time
accident and a site trip to Chester races if successful! The site
is well on the way to achieving this with 280,000 man hrs recorded
and an AFR (accident frequency rate) of zero."</p>

<p>Costain's staff at the Bell Common M25 tunnel refurbishment
programme for the Highways Agency, have gone into 2010 determined
to maintain their 2009 safety performance that saw them turn in
more than a million man-hours without a single reportable
accident.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Up to 200 people are working on the £90million programme to
bring the tunnel on the northern stretch of the M25 London orbital
motorway up to the latest safety standards.</p>

<p>The project got underway in October 2008 and is currently
"significantly ahead" of the projected March 2010 completion date,
although Project Manager, Andy Firth, cautions that much
commissioning work remains to be done before the tunnel can be
handed back to the Highways Agency.</p>

<p>He puts much of the speedy progress to date down to an
established supply-chain and an integrated project delivery team
with the client's representatives, Mouchel.&nbsp; Extensive
off-site precasting and prefabrication of components for the
refurbishment has also helped.</p>

<p>Moving this work off-site has also helped in the project's fine
safety record to date, says Firth. By the end of 2009, around 1.1
million man-hours had been completed without a reportable accident.
Firth puts the safety record down to "Very careful planning and
lots of innovation in terms of the work. There's also very close
interaction with the supply chain, which is the same as on our
similar previous M25 job, the Holmesdale tunnel."</p>

<p>Other factors helping to keep down the accident rate include a
site drug and alcohol policy, plus medicals for all personnel
before they start work.</p>

<p>2 February 2010</p>

<p>The Tesco Gerrards Cross project, with Costain as main
contractor, has now exceeded 600,000 working man-hours without a
RIDDOR reportable incident in the four years since work first
commenced in early 2006.</p>

<p>This milestone was achieved in January 2010, and underlines the
degree to which health and safety is the number one commitment for
all Costain staff and subcontractor operatives on the Tesco
Gerrards Cross project. RIDDOR reportable incidents include
over-3-day injuries, injuries to members of the public and
dangerous occurrences on site.</p>

<p>Costain Project Manager, Martin Baughurst, commented: "This
achievement is demonstrable proof of the safety level we've made
paramount in all aspects of the project; we will strive to maintain
our perfect safety record for the remainder of the works."</p>

<p>The project's client representative, Tesco Stores Limited
Development Manager, Andy Lloyd, added: "This is a well managed
project; 600,000 man-hours is an excellent reflection on what is a
safe site."</p>

<p>The project, a technically complex scheme to repair a partially
collapsed rail tunnel and subsequently construct a new reinforced
concrete arch structure over the top, with the existing tunnel
employed as permanent formwork, is progressing well. The reinforced
concrete overbuild is due to be completed in June 2010, which will
be followed by the completion of backfilling works utilising both
conventional aggregate and light-weight foamed concrete. The new
Tesco store to be built on top of this structure is due to be
completed and open for trading before the end of 2010.</p>

<p>Costain announces that it has been appointed, in joint venture
with Lagan Construction and Ferrovial Agroman, to Phase 1 of an
Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) contract for the A8 Belfast to
Larne dualling scheme in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The A8 is a strategically important road within Northern
Ireland.&nbsp; This stretch of the A8 carries in excess of 17,000
vehicles per day and is important to the economy of Northern
Ireland because the port of Larne must be serviced by an efficient
road link.</p>

<p>The client for the contract is Roads Service, Northern
Division.&nbsp; The contract, which has a total value of £80
million, is to support Roads Service in taking the scheme through
the statutory processes, including Public Inquiry, and in designing
and constructing the scheme.</p>

<p>Commenting on the contract award, Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive
of Costain, said:</p>

<p>"This ECI contract, for a new blue-chip client with a large
portfolio of future schemes, strengthens our position as one of the
UK's leading solution providers in highways and adds to our
portfolio of significant highways projects."</p>

<p>27 January 2010</p>

<p>Waste reduction and sustainability remain a top priority when
constructing the £90million Church Village Bypass.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rhondda Cynon Taf Council's contractors Costain acknowledge its
corporate responsibility to promote waste reduction and to ensure
that every opportunity is taken to utilise locally sourced and
recycled material.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the support of the Council, stringent waste and
sustainability targets have been set and as the completion date of
Autumn 2010 grows nearer, all of these targets are expected to be
achieved or surpassed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The construction industry is responsible for an estimated 120
million tonnes of waste every year, approximately one third of all
UK waste.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A key aim of the project is to incorporate as much
site-generated waste as possible into the works to eliminate
disposal to landfill. To date over 99% of waste arising from site
activities has been re-used in the construction
works.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As part of the value engineering exercise undertaken, the
alignment of the new carriageway was engineered to both reduce the
volume of earthworks required and also balance the
earthworks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This has meant that no material has had to be imported to
complete the earthworks nor has any waste material been sent to
landfill.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The culvert and bridge structures have been designed to reduce
the volume of materials required in construction and these have
then been manufactured off-site in factory environments, further
reducing the waste normally associated with in-situ
construction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Secondary aggregates have been used to form the carriageway and
to reduce the impact of using virgin aggregates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Blast furnace slag has been locally sourced for use in both the
carriageway sub-grade and the tarmacadam surfacing. It estimated
that by the time the project is completed, over 250,000 tonnes of
this material will have been used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the construction of the earthworks, the site has
excavated almost 20,000 tonnes of peat and some is being re-used
with other site-won earth to manufacture topsoil
replacement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This means the site will avoid the need to import topsoil to
complete the landscaping works and ensures that potential waste
material is re-used effectively on site.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The project team has set a range of waste targets that are
continually monitored to ensure that materials are not wasted.
Material use is reconciled on a central database with progress
against targets issued regularly to the project team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following close liaison with the Environment Agency, appropriate
licences were obtained enabling the project to utilise
approximately 300,000 excavated tyres, 60,000 tonnes of pulverised
fuel ash &nbsp;and 50,000 tonnes of construction waste into the
construction works.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tyres, which can no longer be sent to landfill, were
cleaned, guillotined and compressed into bales which were used in
the landscape design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dan Powrie, Costain Construction Manager said: "We have worked
very closely with our client Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough
Council and the Environment Agency to ensure that every opportunity
has been taken to minimize the environmental impact of our
work".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cllr Andrew Morgan, Cabinet Member for Transport and Customer
Care explained: "Waste reduction and sustainability is a priority
for Rhondda Cynon Taf in all of the services we provide and clearly
this message is just as important when undertaking the Church
Village Bypass.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"With careful planning, our contractors have successfully
ensured that 99% of waste arising from site activities has been
re-used in the construction work. The movement of 100,000 cubic
metres of soil at Power Station Hill and the baling of 300,000
tyres found nearby is a perfect example of this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The sustainability record so far has been exemplary and as the
completion of the Church Village Bypass grows ever nearer, we will
ensure such high standards are maintained for the benefit of the
local and for that matter, global, environment."</p>

<p>The Costain Group has come to the aid of people hit by the
recent Cumbrian floods.</p>

<p>The UK's leading contractor, as part of its community work
associated with the nuclear project at Sellafield, has donated
£5,000 to the Cumbria Flood Recovery Fund which helps businesses
and people hit by the floods.</p>

<p>Elaine Wise, Development Director for the Cumbria Community
Foundation, said the recovery fund total stood at £1.7million but
was still rising because proceeds from fundraising activities over
the Christmas period were still rolling in.</p>

<p>She thanked, on behalf of the Foundation all those individuals,
families and businesses who have made donations.</p>

<p>19 January 2010</p>

<p>A major&nbsp; milestone has been achieved at the St Germans
Pumping Station nr. King's Lynn in Norfolk when water was
introduced into the cofferdam for the first time.</p>

<p>Costain Project Manager Ritchie Burcombe and his team are
delighted to have achieved this landmark after three years working
on this complex contract. It was in April 2008 that the cofferdam
was pumped dry to allow works to commence and in the succeeding 9
months, some 450 CFA piles and 12,000 cubic metres of reinforced
concrete were constructed by Costain, before starting work on the
structural steel framework for the Pump Hall itself. The building
was handed over at the end of May 2009 to allow the pumps and
M&amp;E equipment to be installed whilst Costain completed the rest
of the building and prepared the works for the controlled flooding
of the cofferdam.</p>

<p>Over the next six weeks the remaining works within the cofferdam
will be completed and the water levels increased to allow the pumps
to be commissioned at the end of February. Once the pumps are
commissioned, the diversion channel will be closed and the
cofferdam removed. Demolition of the existing pumping station and
earthworks to the channels will complete the works.</p>

<p>The contract, being carried out for the Middle Level
Commissioners, is to replace the existing pumping station that
serves to drain a large part of the Fens. It was constructed in the
1930's and the age of the existing pumping station, together with
greater water run-off within the catchment area and rising sea
levels, led to the decision to replace the existing pumping
station. The new pumping station is situated within the tidal
section of the Great Ouse and the cofferdam, that is now being
flooded, is one of the largest in current use in this country.</p>

<p>Costain for the second year running, celebrated success at the
annual Institute of Water* awards held in Cardiff. The prestigious
awards recognise and reward outstanding innovations within the
water industry.</p>

<p>The team, from Dwr Cymru Welsh Water, received the Customer
Service award. Team members were presented with the award in
recognition of the 'drop-in sessions' that were held for DCWW
customers living in the Prestatyn and Rhyl areas, who have been
deeply affected by flooding.</p>

<p>The primary function of the 'drop-in process' is to anticipate
potential customer issues and diffuse the situation through data
collection and good customer communication. Comprising of five
stages, the process initially involves setting up a Flood Forum
with affected residents and local authority representatives to gain
an understanding of the issues. Further resident interviews are
undertaken and an open 'drop-in session' is held for customers to
speak to our team of experts. Progress is communicated through the
distribution of a newsletter and finally, a formal close out at the
conclusion of the investigative and mitigation work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Prestatyn, this new process facilitated the development of a
better working relationship with other authorities, relieved the
pressure to deliver an unfunded scheme, and most importantly, it
led to improved customer satisfaction.</p>

<p>Costain Framework Director, John Madden, said: "This award
demonstrates the Costain teams' commitment to the 'Being Number
One' strategy and is another great example of the excellent
customer service we pride ourselves on. We will be taking this
process and developing it further to ensure that customers in other
areas will also benefit from the 'drop-in process'."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>* The Institute of Water is the only professional body dedicated
to supporting the careers of people working in the UK water
industry. Founded in 1945, the Institute of Water offers a unique
and independent learning, development and networking framework to
the water industry.</p>

<p><strong>Costain, which will announce preliminary results for the
year ended 31 December 2009 on Wednesday 10 March 2010, is issuing
a trading update ahead of entering its Close Period.</strong></p>

<p>Trading during the final quarter of 2009, and consequently for
the year as a whole, remained in-line with the Board's
expectations.</p>

<p>The Group's operations continued to benefit from the deliberate
focus on targeted blue chip customers whose major spending plans
are underpinned by strategic national priorities in chosen sectors.
Costain has a proven scale and capability to deliver complex
solutions to major customers and as a result has entered 2010 with
a strong order book and pipeline of opportunities.</p>

<p>As at 31 December 2009, the Group's Forward Order Book had grown
to £2.6 billion, a 30% increase on the previous year (2008: £2.0
billion). Whilst we believe that market conditions will remain
uncertain in 2010, the Order Book includes over £850 million of
work secured for 2010, ahead of the position for 2009 at this time
last year.</p>

<p>The order book has benefited from a number of major contract
awards during the year, including:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">- five-year AMP 5 water frameworks
for Severn Trent and United Utilities;<br />
- the major Evaporator D nuclear project at Sellafield;<br />
- the Midlands Works Contract 4 and five-year MAC 12 Highways
contracts reflecting the Group's strategic growth in maintenance
activity;and<br />
- the Manchester Waste contract, part of Europe's largest waste
project.</p>

<p>In addition, the Group has preferred bidder positions of over
£400 million reflecting success in converting previous preferred
positions into firm orders.</p>

<p>The Group maintained its strong cash position significantly in
excess of £100 million.</p>

<p>Andrew Wyllie, Chief Executive, commented:</p>

<p><strong><em>"Costain continues to differentiate itself as a
result of its strategic focus on customers who are expected to
continue with their major investment programmes despite the current
economic environment. We have a significantly increased order book,
a strong cash position and an ongoing rigorous management of
costs."</em></strong></p>

<p>Highways Agency engineers and contractors (including Costain) in Greater Manchester have won an award for innovation, after delivering improvements along the M61 at the same time as reducing inconvenience to drivers.</p>
<p>The use of the Dynamic Roadspace Utilisation Manager (DRUM) for the first time anywhere outside the South East shaved two weeks off the time needed to deliver the £4.1million scheme between Junctions 3 and 4 of the motorway near Bolton.</p>
<p>By utilising DRUM, engineers were able to calculate windows when contractors were able to extend work beyond traditional working times - enabling them to finish the work to install a new concrete safety barrier and other improvements more quickly.</p>
<p>The system works by using trailer-mounted sensors to acquire live, real-time data on traffic flow. By combining this fresh information with historical statistics, specially-designed software then calculates the optimum time for lane closures, improving the pace at which roadworks can be undertaken.</p>
<p>The work on the M61, which also included bridge improvements, began at the end of May and was finished two weeks ahead of schedule on Saturday, September 12, saving £250,000 in the process.</p>
<p>Around 80,000 drivers use this section of the M61 each day and Highways Agency Project Sponsor John Mather said, "No one likes roadworks but they are a necessity to keep our motorways operating safely.  By using DRUM we were able to ensure that the work was completed and roadworks lifted sooner than originally anticipated.</p>
<p>"Using DRUM on this scheme has saved us time and public money as well as reducing inconvenience to our customers using the motorway network."</p>
<p>The benefits of deploying DRUM along the M61 included fitting in 20 extra hours work at the weekends with day and night shifts getting on with work without getting in each other's way.</p>
<p>DRUM was devised by contractor Costain, transport consultancy TRL and technology supplier MTS. It will now be considered for use during other schemes in the North West.</p>
<p>Its use on the M61 scooped first prize for innovation in the Agency's own Phil Stanton awards.  The internal competition is designed to encourage fresh construction solutions from contractors within the Highways Agency's Construction Management Framework. The framework covers south Lancashire, Merseyside, Greater Manchester, Cheshire, Herefordshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire and the West Midlands.</p>

<p>Robert Smyth, a Costain Graduate Process Engineer, has been
named the Best Individual Newcomer to the Industry at the annual
Energy Awards for NOF, one of the leading business development
organisations involved in the UK oil, gas and energy sectors.</p>

<p>Robert, 27, from Reading, works for Costain Energy &amp; Process
based in Manchester.&nbsp; He collected the prestigious accolade,
which is sponsored by the Department of Energy and Climate Change,
for his role in driving forward the business' Carbon Capture
programmes. The award was presented at the event at Hardwick Hall
in Sedgefield, County Durham, which was hosted by NOF Energy, the
UK business development organisation for the oil, gas and energy
sectors.</p>

<p>In addition to the award itself, Robert has won an expenses-paid
trip to one of the oil &amp; gas industry's major events, the
Offshore Technology Conference (OTC), which takes place in Houston,
Texas in May 2010.</p>

<p>Robert, who has an MSc in chemical process design, has been with
Costain for just over a year. In that time has been heavily
involved with the design and commissioning phases of major gas

<p>15 December 2009</p>

<p>Costain is one of two organisations recognised for outstanding
work in education and training with a prestigious award from
Careers Wales West.</p>

<p>The Regeneration and Economic Development department at
Pembrokeshire County Council and Costain in Pembrokeshire have been
awarded a Careers Wales West Valued Partner Award for their
commitment to work with local students and teachers.</p>

<p>Engineering and construction company Costain works in
partnership with Careers Wales West and Construction Skills to
raise teachers and students awareness of the construction industry
and the exciting developments currently underway in the area. The
company has been delivering interactive sessions to local primary
school pupils on the importance of health and safety and has even
been offering professional development opportunities for Careers
Wales West advisors so they can provide the most up-to-date advice
and information on the sector.</p>

<p>The Regeneration and Economic Development department at
Pembrokeshire County Council has also been awarded for the role it
has played in growing the Careers Wales West Enterprise Education
programme. It introduced the Pembrokeshire Enterprise Fair, which
saw young people from across the region setting up and running
their own companies and even taking part in a trading event. The
department has also been working with Careers Wales West and local
teachers to develop new ways of introducing enterprise into the
school curriculum.</p>

<p>Ray Collier, Chief Executive of Careers Wales West, said: "Both
Pembrokeshire County Council and Costain have shown unwavering
support to our clients in recent years. It is so important that we
have partnerships with local organisations like these so that we
can continue to provide local people and businesses with careers
information, advice and guidance to provide brighter futures.</p>

<p>"Their commitment has meant that many more lives have been
enriched, whether it is the experience of running your own business
to learning more about a new industry and what's happening in your
community. We are proud to call them our partners, which is why we
have named them our Careers Wales West Valued Partners 2009."</p>

<p>Phil Baker, a Costain Public Liaison Officer, at the A40,
commented: "Costain is delighted to be honoured with the Valued
Partner Award, following our close work with Careers Wales West and
Construction Skills on the A40 Robeston Wathen By-pass. As a
company we take our responsibilities seriously when working in the
community and would like to believe that by engaging with the young
people of Pembrokeshire we may light a spark which could lead them
into a construction career."</p>

<p>Budding engineers and architects from a Llantwit Fardre school
paid an exciting visit to the Church Village Bypass project to view
the massive construction work currently being undertaken.</p>

<p>A group of 30 children from Year 6 of Maesybryn Primary School
in Crown Hill visited the Church Village Bypass Visitors centre in
Cross Inn to learn more about the scheme that is being built close
to their classrooms.</p>

<p>Rhondda Cynon Taf Council's contractors for the £90million
scheme welcomed the children for the visit that was jointly
coordinated with engineers Capita Glamorgan and the Education
Business Partnership.</p>

<p>The Council's Cabinet Member for Transport and Customer Care
Cllr Andrew Morgan explained: "This was one of a total of 10 visits
planned for local schools who are undertaking a Church Village
Bypass-related project as part of their curriculum.</p>

<p>"During their visit they certainly had an ideal opportunity to
learn more about the complexities of developing what is the largest
highways scheme currently being undertaken by any local authority
in the UK.</p>

<p>"This was an ideal opportunity for them to see the tremendous
amount of work already completed and the remaining developments yet
to come before Autumn 2010."</p>

<p>The Maesybryn pupils chose to review the different occupational
roles involved in undertaking a major construction project and
interviewed a Quantity Surveyor, a Designer, an Engineer, a
Business Manager and a Plant Operator.</p>

<p>They also received a presentation on site safety and witnessed a
display by the plant operator in the car park of the site offices
in Cross Inn. Before leaving, all the pupils were able to wear
safety clothing and were taken to Tonteg to view the construction
works on Power Station Hill.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Brian Greaves, Community Relations Manager for Costain, said: "The
visit was a great success and we have provided some material and
background information for the children to continue with their
project back at school.</p>

<p>"The construction team is very conscious the project provides a
considerable learning opportunity for many educational groups in
the community and we are doing our best to maximise the opportunity
for schools and colleges to visit the project."<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Philip Monk, a teacher at Maesybryn Primary School, added: "The
children really enjoyed the visit and like with many learning
experiences great benefit was gained by the opportunity to
interview at first hand key workers, to see a JCB operator
demonstrating the use of the machine and actually visiting a key
section of the construction.</p>

<p>"The children have been given a good start with some really good
material and I am looking forward to seeing the project progress in
the classroom over the next few weeks."</p>

<p>The Evaporator D Project at Sellafield, with Costain as main
contractor, has recorded 500,000 working man-hours without a first
aid incident.</p>

<p>That achievement is underlined given that a first aid incident
includes even the most minor accident such as a plaster to cover a
scratch.</p>

<p>The Costain team runs a safety bonus scheme that benefits local
charities and it is the workforce which will choose the charity to
receive the financial reward for this achievement.</p>

<p>The project is progressing well with over 200 in-house designers
and a large site team that is involved with construction of the
reinforced concrete structure and the temporary bridge that will
enable the major elements of the project to be delivered by
sea.</p>

<p>Lincolnshire Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, which delivers
mental health services across Lincolnshire, has appointed Costain
to build the county's new £15million rehabilitation
facility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Len Hartley, Project Manager at the Trust, said: "We're
delighted to be able to announce the appointment of Costain to
design and build the new rehabilitation services buildings on the
St George's Hospital site in Lincoln. Costain can clearly
demonstrate a particularly good understanding of mental health
facilities, a strong partnering ethos, and a practical and
economical approach to the design and build of the new
facilities."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The building work involves the demolition of the existing
Yarborough Court located at the rear of St George's Hospital on
Long Leys Road.&nbsp; It will replace the two existing in-patient
wards already on the site and a third female-only ward will be
built which is a new development for the Trust.&nbsp; The one-story
rehabilitation facility will be fully operational by March 2012 and
will accommodate a total of 45 service users at any one
time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alex Vaughan, Managing Director for Community Sectors, Costain
said: "I am extremely pleased that we have this opportunity to work
in partnership with the Trust to support its ambitions to deliver
an excellent service comprising first-class facilities.&nbsp; This
is an important project for the Trust and everyone in the project
team is excited about working together to achieve a successful
outcome."</p>

<p>Service users, their families, carers and the local community,
along with the Trust's clinical staff have been involved throughout
the consultation process and have made valuable contributions to
the overall design.</p>

<p>The Trust's Clinical Coordinator, Ann Dodd said:&nbsp; "The new
facility will enable local service users to access mental health
rehabilitation services that will best meet their needs and be
closer to their local community and families.</p>

<p>"The whole service is focused on working towards independence
and recovery to enable service users to regain health and mental
wellness before moving to live as independently as possible when
they are discharged."</p>

<p>Primary school pupils in Pembrokeshire were recently given a
taste of the construction industry.</p>

<p>Eleven schools were invited to take part in a Grand Design
challenge held at Prendergast primary school in Haverfordwest.
Organised by Pembrokeshire County Council and Construction Skills
and supported by Costain, the schools were set the challenge to
construct a four meter high tetrahedron and the designing and
building of a crane jib. The event aimed to give pupils a practical
taste of construction skills, an insight of the industry and helped
develop links between the community, businesses and schools.</p>

<p>Phil Baker, Costain Public Liaison Officer based at the A40
improvement project in Pembrokeshire, was on hand to give a
presentation of the scheme to the youngsters and as a Construction
Ambassador led the tetrahedron challenge. Phil commented that the
children were eager to take part and listened intently to the
safety instructions and the construction methods.</p>

<p>The crane challenge had been developed by Cambridge University
and encouraged pupils to design, build and test a crane jib using
rolled paper components, bolted together and tested on a rig. The
testing of the jib was the highlight of the day with one kilogram
bags of sugar used to load the construction.</p>

<p>This is the only event of its kind in Wales and was supported by
a number of Construction Ambassadors, Cllr Huw George Pembrokeshire
Cabinet member for Children, Young People, Learning and Welsh
Language, said:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
"The Grand Designs Event at Prendergast School was a challenging
yet enjoyable day for all the pupils (and their teachers).</p>

<p>"The young peoples' determination shone through enabling many of
them to complete the test successfully. They learnt so much as
individuals and as teams and I know that they returned to their
respective Schools with great pride.</p>

<p>"It would be beneficial to challenge Secondary School Pupils in
the same way!</p>

<p>"Good Event - well organised - totally worthwhile."</p>

<p>20 November 2009</p>

<p>Twenty months after successfully bidding to revitalise one of
the UK's busiest trunk roads, a Costain-Skanska joint venture has
reached a major milestone in the A14 Contract.</p>

<p>The publishing of Draft Orders for the Ellington - Fen Ditton
scheme, which calls for the joint venture to build the first
section of 36km of road on the A14, "really sets the clock
ticking", says Project Director Mark Berg.</p>

<p>The A14 stretches from Felixstowe Docks in Suffolk to the M1/M6
junction northwest of Northampton. The section, being tackled by
Costain-Skanska, runs through countryside roughly from Huntingdon
to Cambridge.</p>

<p>The project is designed to relieve heavy congestion on the
route. Some new sections of road will be built off-line from the
existing A14, others will run parallel to it and some will see the
existing road expanded.</p>

<p>One major interchange is "almost like Spaghetti Junction" in its
scale and complexity, says Mark Berg. Other sections of the road
will require bridges to be demolished (including one straddling the
East Coast Main Line rail route) and two new structures built
across the rivers Ouse and Cam.</p>

<p>A few statistics from the past 20 months show the scale of the
challenge:</p>

<p>•&nbsp;7869 drawings were created;<br />
•&nbsp;nearly 640 people were involved at some stage, as were 35
different offices;<br />
•&nbsp;almost 300 meetings were held with local councils,
businesses and landowners;<br />
•&nbsp;in total, 12,662 documents were produced.</p>

<p>The publishing of the Draft Orders is a significant stage in the
statutory process. A public enquiry is due to be held in June 2010.
It is anticipated that, if the go-ahead is given, work will start
in spring 2012 and be completed in late 2015.</p>

The main Northbrook Street entrance to Parkway - the new retail-led
mixed-use scheme (being developed with Costain as main contractor)
is now taking shape.</p>

<p>Steel framework for the new three and four storey buildings is
now rising from ground level behind the listed, 18th century
frontages that have been retained on Northbrook Street. The
buildings, which will be located on either side of the new East
Street entrance to the development, will provide a link to the many
new shops at the heart of the scheme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This combination of old and new is a key theme throughout
Parkway, which has been designed to be both contemporary and yet in
keeping with Newbury's historic market town environment.</p>

<p>On opening in spring 2011, Parkway - which is being developed by
Standard Life Investments - will boast over 50 new shops, including
a new full range Debenhams department store, as well as new
restaurants and cafés. It will also include 184 new homes.</p>

<p>The Parkway project at Newbury, with Costain as main contractor,
played host to West Berkshire councillors recently.</p>

<p>David Woodhouse, the Costain Project Director, gave a
presentation about the logistics of the retail/development project
and the way in which Costain was dealing with the problems of
ground water and diversion of services.&nbsp; The councillors were
shown drawings together with artist's impressions of the structures
that were being erected and a series of aerial photos that showed
the progress to date.</p>

<p>The councillors also heard about details of the work and
co-operation Costain was undertaking with local schools in the
area. Costain also invited one of the outstanding work experience
students along - Sophie Cath, from St Bartholomew's School - to
give a first-hand account of her recent stay with the project that
has prompted her to seek a career in Civil Engineering.</p>

<p>After the presentation, the councillors were taken on a tour of
the site where they were able to see the progress being made on the
massive excavation for the underground car park and the erection of
the steelwork for Debenhams and shops in the new East Street. The
councillors expressed their gratitude for the tour which had given
them a better understanding of the size and complexity of the work
involved and thanked Costain for their efforts in minimising
disruption to the Newbury Town Centre.</p>

<p>The UK has to press on and get a new generation of power
stations off the stocks if blackouts are to be avoided a few years
from now.</p>

<p>Stephen Wells, Group Strategy and Business Development Director,
delivered this message to a high-powered London conference debating
whether the country has the right mix of energy supplies for the
years ahead.</p>

<p>The CBI-organised conference attracted around 150 energy
specialists, power generating companies, funders, regulators, the
construction sector and media. They listened as speakers from
Government, power companies, plus the financial and energy sectors,
gave their opinions on the ideal balance of energy sources.</p>

<p>Costain and power generator EdF supported and sponsored the
event respectively, held at the Royal Society's headquarters near
Pall Mall.</p>

<p>The CBI recently produced a 12-point recovery plan for whichever
party wins next year's general election, which included energy gap
and security of supply as a key issue. It believes that the current
emphasis on renewable energy should be scaled back from the planned
30%+ to around 24%, partly because it believes the target is simply
too ambitious and partly because delivery of renewable energy
projects in the past has been slow.</p>

<p>In his comments from the platform Stephen stressed the need to
get construction of new nuclear power stations underway - a policy
underlined by the Government a few days later when it announced
plans for 10 new nuclear stations around the UK within the national
policy statements.</p>

<p>Setting aside his Costain hat later, Stephen added that the
British loved debating major programmes like this, but that the
time for debate was fast running out: "I'm also a taxpayer and
citizen and it concerns me that we could get to the point where we
have power cuts. Do we have to get to the point where power
supplies are disrupted to make the UK public aware of the
problem?"</p>

<p>The Government has recently set up the Infrastructure Planning
Commission (IPC) to speed up the planning process for critically
important UK infrastructure projects such as new nuclear stations.
However, the Conservatives were talking of abolishing it, said
Stephen, because they feared central government would lose control
of the process given its independent status.</p>

<p>Such a move risked scaring off European nuclear power companies,
who feared any investment in new power stations would get bogged
down in years of planning process.</p>

<p>The conference, he added, had been useful for Costain as it had
raised the Group's profile in the marketplace. "We've been seen to
have an opinion on the whole subject, not just the construction
aspects of it. We were there supporting a nationally-important
debate for the future wellbeing of the British people and our
economy."</p>

<p>It was raucous and it was rhythmic ... it was Construction Rocks
2009, an industry 'battle of the bands' charity event.</p>

<p>Helping to keep the event's running order was Costain's
Birmingham-based&nbsp; Innovation Manager Peter Ball, himself a
keen musician but on this occasion helping out on the
organisational side.</p>

<p>Held in St Pancras, London, the event brought together 10 bands
from construction companies or with involvement in the sector, with
the aim of raising money for Great Ormond Street Hospital and
Sports Aid.</p>

<p>Costain helped sponsor the event by providing Peter's services;
his stage manager duties covered everything from setting-up to
clearing up at the end of the night.</p>

<p>With each band putting up £100 as an entry fee and refreshments
being sold to the crowd of several hundred that turned up for an
evening of rock, a very respectable £5,000 was raised in just a few
hours.</p>

<p>Construction plant always holds a fascination for youngsters,
which helps explain why Costain's stand was the place to be at
Newbury's annual Sunday Funday.</p>

<p>Three staff from the team constructing the Newbury Parkway
development in the Berkshire town - Andy Smith, Sharon Lawton and
Gareth Buisson - gave up their time to give the Company a presence
at the event.</p>

<p>They were needed, as a steady stream of visitors (about 1,000 by
the end of the day) poured over the exhibit.</p>

<p>Star of the show, said Liaison Manager Andy Smith, was the
digger. "For most of the day we had a queue of about 30 youngsters
waiting to sit in it and have their picture taken for the family
album.</p>

<p>"It was just a pity they discovered the horn still worked even
when the digger was immobilised!"</p>

<p>A Bob the Builder colouring table and two sand pits were also
very popular with the younger children. The team also dished out
hundreds of lollypops to the children who visited the stand
(including quite a few that were nearer pension age than school
age!)</p>

<p>"The team also raised over £100 for the town's fire brigade
charitable efforts, by running a Hidden Treasure competition where
entrants had to guess the weight of a sand-filled jar with a prize
hidden inside. The money was handed over to station commander Matt
Frayne after the day was over," said Andy.</p>

<p>Swathes of sheeting and scaffolding currently cover it, but the
building under construction by Costain in Gracechurch Street, in
the City of London, is shaping up to cut a prestigious figure in
the capital's cityscape.</p>

<p>The high quality nine-storey office block, with retail units on
the ground and lower ground floors, will be clad in Portland stone
to blend in with a retained facade on part of the site.</p>

<p>The £31million development, close to Monument Tube station, is
the fourth project Costain has handled for Arab Investments. The
Gresham Street project, completed in March 2009, was the third.</p>

<p>"In Gracechurch Street, two banks were demolished to create one
building," explains Senior Project Manager Mark Sowerby.</p>

<p>The usual tight site problems in Central London - the building
occupies the entire site footprint - are compounded by the presence
outside of a 'no stopping' Red Route and months of negotiations
with Transport for London were required to agree temporary
suspensions of a nearby bus stop, which is used as a loading bay,
he adds.</p>

<p>To minimise traffic problems, Costain has constructed a steel
platform inside the site boundary on to which delivery vehicles can
drive and unload. Concrete trucks, for example, park there and
discharge their loads into a static pump, the material is then
directed to wherever on site it is required.</p>

<p>The client set up noise and vibration monitors on adjoining
party walls (including the historic St Clements church) to ensure
disturbance to neighbours was minimised.</p>

<p>The project is two-thirds complete and is expected to finish on
schedule next June.</p>

<p>Thousands of discarded tyres, acres of power station waste...and
butterflies. All problems that Costain's team on the Church Village
Bypass in South Wales had to overcome to relieve local residents
from challenging traffic conditions.</p>

<p>The 7.5km bypass will take 70 per cent of traffic off the A473
where it runs through the village. It's the latest in a series of
such schemes Costain has tackled for Rhondda Cynon Taf Council in
recent years to&nbsp;alleviate congested valley roads.</p>

<p>The £90million contract includes four roundabouts, three foot
bridges, two road bridges and one equestrian underpass. However, a
major value engineering exercise has hugely reduced the complexity
of the scheme, says Project Manager Barry Woodman.</p>

<p>"In value engineering terms I think we've done a job that would
be hard to beat," he says. Originally there were to be nine
bridges. A 500m retaining wall has also been deleted and structures
generally reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>The two road bridges and culverts are being pre-cast in sections
off-site, which brings both quality and safety advantages.</p>

<p>Work began in spring 2008 and progress has been so good that
virtually all the structures are already in place, a year ahead of
the scheme's completion date of autumn 2010.</p>

<p>Environmental considerations have been high on the agenda:
dormice, otters, bats and a rare type of fritillary butterfly have
had to be protected or relocated.</p>

<p>The team has also made several positives out of negatives along
the route. One landfill site concealed 300,000 old tyres, while
others contained huge quantities of pulverised fly ash from a
disused power station. "That made ground conditions particularly
interesting," says Woodman.</p>

<p>However, the tyres have been bound together to help create a
retaining wall and the ash reshaped into bunds and landscaping
features to screen the site from homes.</p>

<p>With much of the heavy work complete and around 20 per cent of
the roadway laid, the team is keeping its foot on the accelerator
to finish on schedule next year.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>26 October 2009</p>
<p>The Castleford Bridge in Yorkshire, a Costain project, has won the RIBA CABE Public Space Award.</p>
<p>This award is sponsored by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE), the government's advisor on architecture, urban design and public space.  Presented to the architects and landscape architects of the best RIBA Award-winning public space in the United Kingdom, the award recognises the valuable contribution that a well-designed public realm makes to the quality of the built environment and to our daily lives.</p>
<p>The Bridge spans the river with a subtle S-bend that is set lightly on three supports. The timber boardwalk has been elegantly detailed to align with the line of movement. Benches arc out of its surface giving a range of seating heights for all ages and the balustrade provides a leaning rail to view the river. The architect's attention to the human scale makes the bridge accessible and much loved by the inhabitants of Castleford. The community's local pride in their involvement and achievement of building the bridge should help it stand the test of time.<br /> <br />Speaking about the bridge, Sarah Gaventa, Director of CABE Space said:</p>
<p>"The Bridge over Castleford 'Bay' is a really engaging public space. It provides a real meeting place for local people and has helped strengthen Castleford's relationship with its river.</p>
<p>"It is greatly loved and enjoyed by the local community who played a big role in its design, and it has pushed the definition of public space, proving that a bridge can offer as much as a street, public square, or park. It is a true public space because it can be used and enjoyed by everyone."</p>

<p>15 October 2009</p>

<p><strong>Costain, the engineering and construction group, is
issuing its Interim Management Statement covering the period from 1
July 2009 to the current date.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
In August, the Group reported a strong operating result for the
first half of 2009, and that it had entered the second half of the
year with a record order book, robust finances and a net cash
balance in excess of £100 million.</p>

<p>Since then, Costain has continued to perform in line with the
Board's expectations.</p>

<p>The Group's strategy remains focused on major blue-chip
customers, particularly those whose capital investment programmes
are necessitated by legislation or regulation, or where projects
are of high priority in the current uncertain economic
environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Order Book</strong><br />
The Group's quality forward order book has increased further to a
new record level of £2.7 billion, up from £2.5 billion at 30 June
2009.</p>

<p>This increased order book follows major contract awards
including:</p>

<p>-&nbsp;an extension to its current 5-year AMP4 framework
contract with United Utilities worth £170 million;<br />
-&nbsp;a £297 million contract for Sellafield Ltd for the
Evaporator D project extending the project from the original
planning into the delivery phase; and<br />
-&nbsp;Bradford Schools Phase 2 PFI, in joint venture, valued at
£230 million</p>

<p>Costain continues to see strong levels of tendering activity,
both in established sectors such as water and infrastructure, and
in newer business areas such as nuclear and waste. The Group's
preferred bidder position is currently in excess of £400 million
reflecting recent successes in converting previous preferred
positions to firm orders.</p>

<p>The Group has already secured revenues of over £800 million for
2010, substantially ahead of the position for 2009 at this time
last year.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Pension<br />
</strong>Following the proposals as reported in August, the Group
has now completed the 90-day consultation period with staff and
closed the defined benefit pension scheme to future accrual with
effect from 1st October 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Financial Position<br />
</strong>There has been no material change in the financial status
of the Group which continues to enjoy a strong cash position of
well in excess of £100 million and has no significant
borrowings.&nbsp; The average month-end cash balance in 2009 to
date is running slightly ahead of the average for 2008.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Outlook</strong><br />
The Group's ongoing strategic focus continues to provide Costain
with a strong platform and the Board remains confident that the
outcome for 2009 will be in line with its expectations.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The St Martin-in-the-Fields refurbishment/restoration project,
with Costain as the main contractor, has picked up its second
national award this month.</p>

<p>The famous London Church received the British Construction
Industry Awards (BCIA) top prize in the Conservation category. Only
days earlier the project won the Institution of Structural
Engineers' Heritage Award for Buildings.</p>

<p>The 2009 BCIA once again brought a huge entry representing over
170 of the best projects in the UK and those abroad for which UK
Companies had a significant input. The Awards are rigorously judged
with each of the 35 UK shortlisted projects visited by members of
the judging panel and their project teams quizzed on site. Teams
representing the International shortlist of six projects were
interviewed in London and visits made for the judges to glean
further information.</p>

<p>It is well known that the BCIA is not a design competition -
while excellence of architecture or engineering are factors, these
Awards are all embracing with the judges considering many aspects
from procurement, performance against prediction, quality of design
and construction, safety, innovation, sustainability, usability and
benefit to the community among many others listed in the Awards
application form.</p>

<p>The BCIA made its award to St Martin-in-the-Fields 'for a
project designed and executed with respect for original fabric,
design and form while making a minimum intervention consistent with
safety and structural integrity.'&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The judges stated: 'The renewal of St Martin-in-the-Fields in
London's Trafalgar Square is a significant and highly complex
public building project offering a great deal more than just the
famous Church. It's Grade I listed Crypt and three Grade II listed
buildings have been completely upgraded and extensive new spaces
created to provide additional facilities.</p>

<p>'The project is a showcase for the construction industry with a
real wow factor and an uplifting atmosphere. A classic scheme using
a wide range of design and construction skills to upgrade the
buildings. Sensitive refurbishment and upgrade of historic features
have been coupled with totally appropriate new build sections.</p>

<p>'A chaotic working environment has been transformed. St Martin
can now fulfil its important role in London life, with facilities
for the homeless, the local Chinese community and the general
public.'<br />

    <description><![CDATA[<p>13 October 2009</p>
<p><br />One of Costain's recent flagship projects - the restoration and refurbishment of the famous St Martin-in-the-Fields Church in Trafalgar Square London - has received a major award.</p>
<p>The project received the Heritage Award for Buildings from the Institution of Structural Engineers for achievement in structural design involving restoration, conservation, extension or refurbishment of a heritage building, where the style and integrity of the original building is maintained and made evident in the final concept.</p>
<p>Standing at the north-east corner of Trafalgar Square, St Martin-in-the-Fields is a famous London landmark.</p>
<p>Built by James Gibbs in 1730, it is Grade I* listed and was later added to by John Nash in the 1830s with a terrace and underground vaults. All of Nash's work is Grade II* listed.</p>
<p>St Martin-in-the-Fields is famous for its charitable work, offering shelter to the homeless and others in need.</p>
<p>This shelter was provided partly in the Nash terrace and partly in the underground vaults. Neither of these spaces were suitable for this sort of use - the vaults, particularly, being dark and damp.</p>
<p>The major part of the scheme designed by Eric Parry Architects and Alan Baxter &amp; Associates and built by Costain involved the removal of the vaults, replacing them with a new two-storey deep basement.</p>
<p>It says something of the significance and influence of St Martin-in-the-Fields that permission was given for the removal of so much listed fabric.</p>
<p>The great hole in the ground needed to make this transformation had to be carried out without damaging either of the buildings, which were kept in place by a combination of secant piled walls and conventional sheet-piling.</p>
<p>This skilful and carefully executed piece of engineering has transformed the use of a very tight urban site.</p>
<p>The Nash terrace was also significantly reorganised, with a number of sensitive structural interventions.</p>

<p>Costain's £397million Greater Manchester Waste contract has
reached a significant milestone, with the completion of the first
in-vessel composting plant.</p>

<p>The Waithlands plant in Rochdale - currently undergoing final
commissioning tests - is now processing up to 480 tonnes of green
waste and food waste collected from households every week. Over a
period of 14 days it turns the waste into pasteurised compost to be
used as soil improver.</p>

<p>The composting plant - the first of four planned - will be
officially opened in November. The opening will coincide with the
fifth Annual Waste Management Conference, this year hosted by the
Greater Manchester Waste Delivery Authority.</p>

<p>Five of the 43 facilities planned - two transfer loading
stations and three household waste recycling centres - have already
been handed over to the client, Viridor Laing (Greater Manchester)
Limited.</p>

<p>Meanwhile other elements of the contract continue at a pace with
construction activities progressing on 14 sites.&nbsp; On the main
technology sites, preparations are being made for the arrival this
year of some of the primary process components. These include the
'Pulper' units from Germany for the Mechanical Biological Treatment
(MBT) plants, and key parts for the Materials Recycling Facility in
south Manchester, which are presently being shipped from San Diego,
California.</p>

<p>Costain bikers will be remembering Britain's fallen troops in a
charity bike ride on 10 October.</p>

<p>A group of COGAP colleagues will be joining thousands of other
motorcyclists in this year's Ride To The Wall (RTTW) - a ride to
the National Memorial Arboretum near Lichfield, Staffordshire. The
National Memorial features the names of more than 16,000 Service
men and women killed on duty or by terrorist action since the end
of World War 2 engraved around its walls. Last year's inaugural
RTTW raised £10,000 to help with the upkeep of the memorial, and
this year the organisers hope to raise even more.</p>

<p>"All are welcome to come along - you can register on the day,"
said Chris Goodwin, Section Leader in the 2D CAD piping department,
who'll be riding his Benelli Tornado TRE.</p>

<p>The Costain bikers will be meeting up with the Royal British
Legion Riders at Knutsford Services on the M6 at 8am. They will
then ride down to Drayton Manor Park in Tamworth, where the 12-mile
long RTTW will start at 11am.</p>

<p>"It should be quite a day," said Chris. "Last year there were
more than 2000 motorcyclists at the event, 800 of whom registered
on the day. This year 2000 people have already registered, so there
should be a good turn-out."</p>

<p>3 October 2009</p>

<p>A recently completed Costain contract is helping breathe new
life into a previously derelict part of Worcester city centre.</p>

<p>The £19million project on the first phase of Worcester
University's new City Campus involved the construction of two new
student residences. The Costain team also carried out repairs to
Grade II listed buildings that were part of the former Worcester
Royal Infirmary.</p>

<p>The pre-cast concrete residences provide high-quality, en-suite
accommodation for 178 students. Each of the four and six-storey
blocks is fitted with solar panels to heat water, and has a
rainwater harvesting system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Work on the listed Georgian and Victorian buildings - including
one where the first British Medical Association (BMA) meeting was
held in 1832 - involved internal strengthening, the cleaning and
repair of masonry, and the re-roofing of the main building.</p>

<p>The site's city centre location didn't present too many access
problems, said Geoff Hunt, Project Manager, but its proximity to
the Worcester-Hereford railway line did mean close collaboration
with Network Rail.</p>

<p>"The railway was next to the gable ends of the building and we
had to make certain our tower crane didn't oversail the railway
line. We also had to ensure we had all the right permits from
Network Rail when it came to erecting and dismantling the
crane."</p>

<p>Nevertheless the 13-month job came in right on time and was
completed<br />
on 7 September. Students moved into their new home twelve days
later.</p>

<p>The £44million project to rebuild the Wolvercote Viaduct (a
Costain project) on the A34 in Oxfordshire reached a new stage this
month as traffic was allowed onto the new northbound carriageway
for the first time.</p>

<p>Northbound traffic has been using the old southbound carriageway
for the past six months while the Highways Agency (H.A)&nbsp;built
the new section. Southbound traffic will continue to use a
temporary carriageway while the old southbound structure is
demolished and rebuilt.</p>

<p>Following the completion of the switchover, two narrow lanes are
remaining in each direction with a 40mph speed restriction,
enforced by average speed cameras. There will also be 24 hour CCTV
monitoring and a free vehicle recovery service. The speed limit is
for the protection of road users and roadworkers.</p>

<p>Costain is pleased to announce that Integrated Bradford, a
consortium that includes Costain, HSBC, Building Schools for the
Future Investments and Amey Ventures, has reached financial close
on the £230million Bradford Schools Phase 2 PFI Project.</p>

<p>The scheme, which is part of the Bradford 'Building Schools for
the Future' Programme, includes the provision of four secondary
schools for Bradford Metropolitan District Council. The four modern
campus environments also comprise four smaller schools and will
provide dedicated learning for students with special educational
needs. Design and construction of the schools will be provided by
Educo, a Joint Venture between Costain and Ferrovial Agroman.</p>

<p>Phase 1 of the Bradford BSF Programme provided for three new
secondary schools, all of which are now in full operation. A
further three new primary schools, currently in construction, will
be handed over in early 2010.</p>

<p>BSF is a £45billion Government initiative to modernise England's
secondary school estate by refurbishing or rebuilding every school
within the next ten years. Bradford BSF was one of the pathfinder
projects, in which the development of new schools is undertaken by
a Local Education Partnership that includes Bradford MDC, Costain,
Amey and Building Schools for the Future Investments.</p>

<p>Costain has been named Major Contractor of the Year by New Civil Engineer magazine for 2009. The previous year Costain also beat all rivals to take the prestigious Award.</p>
<p>New Civil Engineer magazine stated: "Costain has had a massive year - it's as simple as that. Years of positioning itself in the waste industry came home big-style with its £397million Greater Manchester waste PFI contract win in May, and the company's order book now stands at a record £2.4billion."</p>
<p>The New Civil Engineer Award is the second major national media recognition for Costain this year. The Company won the Supreme Award at the Construction News 2009 Quality Awards for the best overall performance which involved being shortlisted six times and winning two categories - Training and Corporate Social Responsibility.</p>
<p>New Civil Engineer also stated in this week's magazine: "Awards are nothing new to the modern Costain. <em>Management Today</em> rates it as "one of the most admired companies in the UK". In the Considerate Constructors Scheme it has won 15 awards, including three Gold Awards. And it is now the first firm to retain a NCE/CECA Contractor of the Year award."</p>

<p>14 August 2009</p>

<p>State-of-the-art facilities designed and built by Costain are
coming into service at Cheltenham General Hospital as the
Gloucestershire NHS Foundation Trust improves its services for its
patients.</p>

<p>The £13.5million St Luke's Wing Phase 2 was officially opened in
July, while a building housing a linear accelerator enhancing
services for cancer treatment is due for completion in early
September.</p>

<p>The four-storey St Luke's wing extension houses stroke and
rehabilitation wards, plus an intensive care and high dependency
unit. Project Manager Kevin Miners explained that the new structure
was slotted into a gap between two existing buildings and then
linked in to existing services all within an extremely tight
area.</p>

<p>Working on a 'live' hospital site naturally meant minimising
noise, dust and disruption, with much work on the 82-week job
taking place at weekends and late at night. "There was a lot of
close liaison with the hospital trust," says Kevin. "We were
connecting to a lot of existing services, and had to break in to
their live systems."</p>

<p>This meant, for example, giving the hospital ample warning that
certain wards would have no water supply for specific periods as
connections were made to the new building.</p>

<p>The second building, a two-storey structure housing a Linear
Accelerator, features a concrete 'bunker' designed to house the
accelerator, which emits radiation as it is used in cancer
treatment.</p>

<p>Containing the radiation required special construction and
methodology measures. "We built big concrete boxes, effectively,
with walls up to 2.4 metres thick," explains Construction Manager
Alex Garwood-Gowers. The concrete was of higher than normal
density, achieved by adding magnetite, a type of iron oxide. The
floor, walls and roof of the bunker each had to be completed in
single pours, to prevent any joints that could allow radiation to
leak.</p>

<p>Two pumps, plus one on standby, were used, and a second concrete
plant was also placed at readiness to ensure supplies if problems
arose at the primary facility. With only two concrete wagons able
to get on to the tight site at any one time, the remainder were
held offsite in a staging area and guided in by marshals as each
wagon finished pumping its load.</p>

<p>In all, 1100m3 of concrete was used in the bunkers.</p>

<p>Both buildings are built around steel frames, hollow rib decking
and concrete slabs, with brick cladding and render facades.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">The Flue Gas Treatment area, Stack Foundation and Air Cooled Condensing areas have been handed over on time to VonRoll, the EPC contractor. A further key milestone was achieved this month when the Boiler/Incinerator line 1 area was released to VonRoll, on programme, for their critical process equipment installation. Lines 2 and 3 have quickly followed.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">VonRoll's Civil and Building Manager Arthur Green said:</p>
<p style="text-align: left">"VonRoll would like to complement the entire Costain team for their efforts to date in making this a successful project for all of us."</p>
<p style="text-align: left">In addition there has also been a Safety Milestone of <strong>One Million</strong> man hours worked without a reportable accident and a zero AFR (Accident Frequency Rate) for 2009.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Francois Charriere the VonRoll Project Director added:</p>
<p>"Despite the worst winter for nearly 20 years and the daily challenges of such projects, the project is on time and the close cooperation between VonRoll Inova and Costain allows an efficient project execution."</p>
<p style="text-align: left">* For the project, Costain is providing design, site infrastructure and building works for the main building, jetties, roads and offices. Overall investment in the project is seen at £350million. The completed facility will be able to process up to 585,000 tonnes of London's residual waste from 2011 and will be able to generate electricity for 66,000 homes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The new facility will enable the majority of the waste to be transported by river in place of upwards of approximately 100,000 lorry trips per annum.</p>

<p>13 July 2009</p>

<p>Lewisham Council has reached two new landmarks in its
multi-million pound programme to transform secondary education in
the London borough.</p>

<p>The signing of the latest contract in Lewisham's Building
Schools for the Future programme means that work can start on
building the new Northbrook School complete with significant
investment in award winning information and communication
technology (ICT) and fully integrated facilities management
services. 600 pupils, teachers and staff will move into their new
school in January 2011.</p>

<p>Design and Construction work will be undertaken by Costain and
ICT and Facilities Management services will be provided by VT.</p>

<p>Father Richard Peers, who joined Northbrook as Head teacher in
September 2008, said: "Students and staff are thrilled that work
has started on our new school building. We cannot wait for the
opportunity to learn in an environment designed for the 21st
Century."</p>

<p>In the same week, the Local Education Partnership has signed a
contract to remodel and refurbish the Hatcham Temple Grove junior
school. The work, which will be completed over a number of phases
will be finished in September 2010.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Lewisham's BSF programme opened the major
phases of Sedgehill School and Catford High School where 2,650
pupils are already enjoying their new learning facilities and
services.</p>

<p>Welcoming the news of the latest contract, Sir Steve Bullock,
Mayor of Lewisham, said:</p>

<p>"This is great news for pupils, parents and teachers across the
borough. They are seeing brand new buildings&nbsp;go up as we
deliver on our promise to renew our primary and secondary
schools.</p>

<p>"Now that work has started on Northbrook and Temple Grove
schools, pupils and teachers can look forward to great new
buildings and facilities that will inspire learning and teaching
for years to come.</p>

<p>"We have established strong links with our partners and,
together, we will continue to work hard to make one of the most
ambitious BSF schemes in the country a reality for Lewisham's young
people."</p>

<p>The Lewisham Schools for the Future Local Education Partnership,
created between the London Borough of Lewisham, Partnerships for
Schools (via Building Schools for the Future investments), Costain
and VT Group, was established in December 2007 to implement the BSF
programme.</p>

<p>Terry Hanafin, Chairman of the Lewisham Schools for the Future
LEP, said:</p>

<p>"We are delighted with the latest progress in the Borough's BSF
programme. It shows what good partnership working can achieve."</p>

<p>Alistair Handford, Costain PFI Director and LSF LEP Board
Director said:</p>

<p>"This is another important milestone for the Local Education
Partnership and for Costain in the provision of education services
including new schools to the borough of Lewisham and to the
children and staff at Northbrook. We look forward to developing the
partnership at Northbrook and the other schools in the
programme."</p>

<p>Tim Byles, Chief Executive of Partnerships for Schools said:</p>

<p>"Lewisham's BSF team and partners have worked hard to ensure
these projects reach financial close and I now look forward to
charting their progress as delivery of new and remodelled schools
gathers momentum."</p>

<p>Northbrook School will provide a new secondary school facility
for 600 students aged from 11 - 16, funded through the government's
Building Schools for the Future Programme.</p>

Evaporator D project, one of the largest nuclear projects in the
UK.</p>

<p>The contract is an extension of an original Purchase Order
awarded in September 2006 for Front End Engineering Design.</p>

<p>Costain has developed and defined the design of the facilities
that will be used to expand Sellafield's ability to process nuclear
waste material and ultimately reduce inventories at the site.</p>

<p>A crucial innovative solution employed by Costain is off-site
and modularized construction. The modules will be shipped in by sea
and transported across the River Ehen and the Barrow to Carlisle
rail lines.</p>

<p>The housed Evaporator building will consist of 15 in-cell
modules, over 22km of pipe work bound together by over 10,000
welds, 300 tons of specialist steel and 400 major plant items.</p>

<p>The project is scheduled for completion in 2014.</p>

<p>Ends</p>

<p>6 July 2009</p>

<p>Costain announces that, in joint venture with Galliford Try and
Atkins, it has secured an extension to its current 5-year AMP4
framework contract with United Utilities. The extension will cover
the period from 1 April 2010 through to 31 March 2015.</p>

<p>The original contract commenced in 2005 with responsibility for
implementing United Utilities non infrastructure capital delivery
works programme in its southern area. The majority of projects are
likely to be improvements to both clean and waste water processing
plants, as was the case with AMP4. The total value of the framework
contract to the GCA joint venture is worth approximately
£400million, and the value to Costain around £180million.</p>
